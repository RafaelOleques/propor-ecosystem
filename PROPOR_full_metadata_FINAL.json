        "Abstract": "This paper presents a study of devoicing of European Portuguese fricatives. Two devoicing criteria (a manual criterion and a criterion based on the ratio of variances of the laryngograph signal during the VF transition and during the fricative) were used to classify the examples into two or three categories. The results of the automatic and manual measures of devoicing are compared, and an explanation for observed misclassifications is presented. Devoicing occurs extensively in Portuguese; results are compared to those for English.",

        "Abstract": "This article suggests a based spectral normalization method, which purpose is to alleviate both the changing on peaks structure and on the flat zones of the speech spectrum, caused by additive noise. The proposed spectral normalization can be viewed as a noise estimate done in a frame by frame basis by assuming the clean database as lightly corrupted. This noise estimate is then used to restore both the peaked and the flat spectral zones of the speech spectrum. This algorithm was implemented over a baseline spectral normalisation method, which purpose is to emphasize the robustness in the regions of less energy of the speech spectrum, since in these regions the noise is more dominant.",

        "Abstract": "The phonetic alignment of the spoken utterances for speech research are commonly performed by HMM-based speech recognizers, in forced alignment mode, but the training of the phonetic segment models requires considerable amounts of annotated data. When no such material is available, a possible solution is to synthesize the same phonetic sequence and align the resulting speech signal with the spoken utterances. However, without a careful choice of acoustic features used in this procedure, it can perform poorly when applied to continuous speech utterances. In this paper we propose a new method to select the best features to use in the alignment procedure for each pair of phonetic segment classes. The results show that this selection considerably reduces the segment boundary location errors.",

We describe the rule formalism and the composition of the various transducers involved in the letter-to-sound conversion. We propose a set of extra SAMPA symbols to be used in the phonetic transcription of Mirandese, and we briefly cover the set of rules and results obtained for the two languages. Although at a very preliminary stage, we also describe our efforts at building a waveform generation module also based on finite state transducers. The use of finite state transducers allowed a very flexible and modular framework for deriving and testing new rule sets. Our experience led us to believe that letter-to-sound modules could be helpful tools for researchers involved in the establishment of orthographic conventions for lesser spoken languages.",

Pustejovsky’s Generative Lexicon was used as a theoretical model. From this model, the Qualia Structure — QS (and the Formal, Telic, Agentive and Constitutive roles) was selected as one of the linguistic and semantic expedients for the achievement of disambiguation of homonym forms. So that analyzed and treated data could be manipulated, we elaborated a Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) where lexical items are correlated and interconnected by different kinds of semantic relations in the QS and ontological information.",

        "Abstract": "Ambiguous strings are strings of non-whitespace characters, typically coinciding with orthographic contractions of word forms, that depending on the specific occurrence, are to be considered as consisting of one or more than one token. This sort of strings is shown to raise the problem of undesired circularity between tokenization and tagging. This paper presents a strategy to resolve ambiguous strings and dissolve such circularity.",

Although a TTS system is usually able to read any type of text, the normal audio rendering may not be appropriate for the contents of an e-mail message. For instance, there are differences in the usefulness of the information in the header, body and signature. E-mail messages also include specific uses of sequences of symbols for e-mail and web addresses, for quoting other messages or for graphical and formatting purposes. Another difficulty is that the message does not contain any indication on the language it is written in and, in some cases, it even includes text in multiple languages. This work tries to handle most of these problems by marking-up the message text with clues for how it should be read by the TTS system.",

Consequently such systems require huge databases for training and testing. The development of large speech corpora in Europe and in the USA was possible only with the cooperation among research centers, universities, private companies and the government. In these countries, the availability of such databases provided the resources which were responsible for the great improvement in speech technologies in the last few years. In Brazil, such consortiums are not even mentioned, and the researchers have to work with small, locally developed databases. In this article we report an effort to develop a large speech corpus for Brazilian Portuguese to fill this crucial gap.",

The system is integrated in an alert system for selective dissemination of multimedia information developed in the scope of an European Project. The goal of this work is to enhance the retrieval of specific spoken documents that have been automatically transcribed, using speech recognition. Our segmentation algorithm is based on simple heuristics related with anchor detection. The indexation is based on hierarchical concept trees (thesaurus), containing 22 main thematic domains, for which Hidden Markov models and topic language models were created. On-going experiments related to multiple topic indexing are also described, where a confidence measure based on the likelihood ratio test is used as the hypothesis test.",

We evaluate our approach using manually produced summaries and automatic summaries produced by three automatic text summarizers for the Brazilian Portuguese language. The results are in agreement with human intuition and showed to be statistically significant.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for building an electronic dictionary of anthroponyms of European Portuguese (DicPRO), which constitutes a useful resource for computational processing, due to the importance of names in the structuring of information in texts. The dictionary has been enriched with morphosyntactic and semantic information. It was then used in the specific task of capitalizing anthroponyms and other proper names on a corpus automatically produced by a broadcast news speech recognition system and manually corrected. The output of this system does not offer clues, such as capitalized words or punctuation. This task expects to contribute in rendering more readable the output of such system. The paper shows that, by combining lexical, contextual (positional) and statistical information, instead of only one of these strategies, better results can be achieved in this task.",

REPENTINO wishes to minimize the problems developers face due to the limited availability of this type of lexical-semantic resources for Portuguese. The data stored in REPENTINO was mostly extracted from corpora and from the web using simple semi-automated methods. Currently, REPENTINO stores nearly 450k instances of named entities divided in more than 100 categories and subcategories covering a much wider set of domains than those usually included in traditional gazetteers. We will present some figures regarding the current content of the gazetteer and describe future work regarding the evaluation of this resource and its enrichment with additional information.",

Then, they need to get a corpus aligned at the sentence level. Such an alignment can require further manual corrections if the parallel corpus contains insertions, deletions, or fuzzy sentence boundaries. This paper shows that it is possible to extract bilingual lexicons without aligning parallel texts at the sentence level. We describe a method to learn word translations from a very roughly aligned corpus, namely a corpus with quite long segments separated by “natural boundaries”. The results obtained using this method are very close to those obtained using sentence alignment. Some experiments were performed on English-Portuguese and English-Spanish parallel texts.",

Apertium uses finite-state transducers for lexical processing, hidden Markov models for part-of-speech tagging, and finite-state-based chunking for structural transfer, and is based on a simple rationale: to produce fast, reasonably intelligible and easily correctable translations between related languages, it suffices to use a MT strategy which uses shallow parsing techniques to refine\nword-for-word\nMT. This paper briefly describes the MT engine, the formats it uses for linguistic data, and the compilers that convert these data into an efficient format used by the engine, and then goes on to describe in more detail the pilot Portuguese\n\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)\nSpanish linguistic data.",

Apart from an extension to over 40 semantic categories, the system was changed from a lexeme-based to a token-based description, defining NER categories as functional and context-based rather than stable and lexematic. The Constraint Grammar rule body was changed accordingly, adding new rules and applying existing heuristic and disambiguation rules to contextual re-mapping of also lexically\nknown\nmaterial. In the joint evaluation, PALAVRAS-NER achieved the best overall results, achieving top ranks for both the identification, classification and morphology tasks.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we describe SIEMÊS, a named-entity recognition system for Portuguese that relies on a set of similarity rules to base the classification procedure. These rules try to obtain soft matches between candidate entities found in text and instances contained in a wide-scope gazetteer, and avoid the need for coding large sets of rules by exploiting lexical similarities. Using this matching procedure, SIEMÊS generates a set of classification hypotheses based solely on internal evidence, which may be disambiguated in a later step by relatively simple rules based on contextual clues. We explain SIEMÊS architecture and its named-entity identification and classification procedure. We also briefly discuss the results of the participation of SIEMÊS in HAREM, the named-entity evaluation contest for Portuguese, and describe future work.",

We present tools that automatically perform nominalization for lexical normalization in Portuguese. Comparing the effects of three alternative strategies (stemming, lemmatizing, and our proposal: nominalization), we demonstrate through an experimental evaluation that nominalization, as lexical normalization, contributes to the performance improvement in a probabilistic information retrieval approach for Portuguese.",

        "Abstract": "Natural Language processing (NLP) systems are typically characterized by a pipeline architecture in which several independently developed NLP tools, connected as a chain of filters, apply successive transformations to the data that flows through the system. Hence when integrating such tools, one may face problems that lead to information losses, such as: (i) tools discard information from their input which will be required by other tools further along the pipeline; (ii) each tool has its own input/output format.\nThis work proposes a solution that solves these problems. We offer a framework for NLP systems. The systems built using this framework use a client server architecture, in which the server acts as a blackboard where all tools add/consult data. Data is kept in the server under a conceptual model independent of the client tools, thus allowing the representation of a broad range of linguistic information.\nThe tools interact with the server through a generic API which allows the creation of new data and the navigation through all the existing data. Moreover, we provide libraries implemented in several programming language that abstract the connection and communication protocol details between the tools and the server, and provide several levels of functionality that simplify server use.",

Each module is composed by multiple cooperative agents which adopt distinct strategies to generate its outputs and cooperate to create a global result. This approach allows the use of different strategies and the reduction of errors introduced by individual methods. The cooperation among the agents aims to reach better solutions in each step of the processing.",

In this paper we will present an Input and Output Manager block that combines speech, synthetic talking face, text and graphical interfaces. The system support speech input through an ASR and speech output through a TTS, synchronized with an animated face. The graphical and text input are feed through a Text Manger that it is a constituent component of the Input and Output Manager block. All the blocks are tailored for the European Portuguese language. The system is analyzed in the framework of the project Interactive\nHome of the Future.",

The first experiments using a recognition system trained for Broadcast News resulted in word error rates near 60%, clearly confirming the need for adaptation to the specific topic of the lectures, on one hand, and for better strategies for handling spontaneous speech. This paper describes the different domain adaptation steps that lowered the error rate to 45%, with very little transcribed adaptation material. It also includes a qualitative analysis of the different types of error, focusing on the ones related to a very high rate of disfluencies.",

To identify the keywords the KEA algorithm was used, together with a stemming technique specific to Portuguese and a manually created list of stopwords. It is shown that the results obtained are good enough for practical use and similarly match what have been done for the English Language.",

Most speech recognition systems resolve the task of recognition on a single stage without having an intermediate phonetic sequence result. The proposed solution is hybrid in the sense that it uses HMMs and Viterbi Decoding for recognizing a phonetic sequence (actually, triphones) and then DTW or One-Stage to generate the corresponding graphemes. Experimental results showed an average accuracy rate of 100% on the recognition of closed sentences, and average word recognition rate of 84% for the continuous speech recognition task.",

In Portuguese, the interpretation of the auxiliary\nestar\nis very similar to the English auxiliary\nto be\nwhen it is combined with a gerund to produce the progressive form. But it has many different interpretations when combined with a verb in the past participle form. In fact, the aspect system in Portuguese is very complex. It has been studied by many people in an interpretation perspective (see [5, 3]). But if we consider the generation perspective, we did not find any work giving some insight on how to achieve it. Our work is thus a fist step in this direction. After a short introduction of the notion of aspect we adopted, we provide an overall description of our grammar.",

        "Abstract": "This presentation focuses on an ongoing project which aims at the creation of a large lexical database of Portuguese multiword (MW) units, automatically extracted through the analysis of a balanced 50 million word corpus, statistically interpreted with lexical association measures and validated by hand. This database covers different types of MW units, like named entities, and lexical associations ranging from sets of favoured co-occurring forms to strongly lexicalized expressions. This new resource has a two-fold objective: to be an important research tool which supports the development of MW units typologies; to be of major help in developing and evaluating language processing tools able of dealing with MW expressions.",

        "Abstract": "A widespread assumption about the analysis of inflection features is that this task is to be performed by a tagger with an extended tagset. This typically leads to a POS precision drop due to the data-sparseness problem. In this paper we tackle this problem by addressing inflection tagging as a dedicated task, separated from that of POS tagging. More specifically, this paper describes and evaluates a rule-based approach to the tagging of Gender, Number and Degree inflection of open nominal morphosyntactic categories. This approach achieves a better F-measure than the typical approach of inflection analysis via stochastic state-of-the-art tagging.",

In this work, we have employed Variable Length Markov Chains (VLMC) for tagging, in the hope of capturing long distance dependencies. We obtained one of the best PoS tagging of Portuguese, with a precision of 95.51%. More surprisingly, we did that with a total time of training and execution of less than 3 minutes for a corpus of almost 1 million words. However, long distance dependencies are not well captured by the VLMC tagger, and we investigate the reasons and limitations of the use of VLMCs. Future researches in statistical linguistics regarding long range dependencies should concentrate in other ways of solving this limitation.",

In a speech recognition system, events can be combined to detect phones, words or sentences, or to identify landmarks with which a decoder could be synchronized. In this paper, we introduce three popular classification techniques, HMM, SVM, ANN and Non-Negative Matrix Deconvolution (NMD) for SED. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of (1) HMM, (2) hybrid SVM/NMD (3) hybrid SVM/HMM and (4) hybrid MLP /HMM approaches to SED and emphasize approaches to reaching lower Event Error Rates (EER). It was found that the hybrid SVM/HMM approach outperformed the HMM system. Regarding EER, an improvement of 6% was achieved. The hybrid MLP/HMM got the best EER rate. Improvements of 11% and 8% were found in comparison with the HMM and hybrid SVM/HMM event detector, respectively.",

Our goal is to create a hands-free home automation system with a speech interface to control home devices. The MA interface enables to create ubiquitous speech acquisition for the SDS. The implemented system allows any user – in any position in a room – to establish a dialog with a virtual butler that is able to control a wide range of home appliances (room lights, air-conditioner, windows shades and hi-fi features). This virtual butler has a 3D animated face that is, while the dialog is engaged, able to steer to the user’s position and respond to his/hers commands with synthesized speech. The presented results show that the MA, as distant talk interface, performs quite well and is a step towards a more realistic human-machine interaction.",

A system for anaphora resolution was built that embeds most of the Mitkov’s features. Some of his resolution factors were directly incorporated into the system; others had to be slightly modified for language adequacy. The resulting approach was intrinsically evaluated on hand-annotated corpora. It was also compared to Lappin & Leass’s algorithm, also customized to pronoun resolution in Portuguese. Success rate was the only evaluation measure used.",

The synthetic speech resulting from such a technique is often improved when accurate segmentation tools are considered. The performance of these tools is often enhanced by a hybrid approach resulting from the association of an HMM modeling with a boundary refining process. Such a refining has been carried out sucessfully by using techniques based on neural networks. This paper presents a set of networks that outperform other topologies discussed in the literature. These networks are trained by performing a clusterization of the training set taking into consideration phonetic transitions with similarities to each other.",

        "Abstract": "Modifications of prosodic parameters in concatenative synthesis systems may lead to a degradation in speech quality, especially when significant pitch changes are accomplished. Aiming to avoid large changes in the speech signal parameters, the speech corpus should present segments with phonetic and prosodic features close to the predicted ones. This condition is more often fulfilled by a speech corpus specially designed to be both phonetic and prosodically rich. The design of this corpus is strongly dependent on the script chosen for recording. For such, a procedure to select the recording script of a TTS system is proposed for the Brazilian Portuguese language. Selected sentences include declarative, exclamatory, and interrogative ones. Phonetic and prosodic information are firstly represented as a set of feature vectors. Next, the amount of distinct feature vectors is used as a fitness value for a genetic-based sentence selection. Experimental results point out a considerable improvement in script variability for speech synthesis applications.",

ASR of broadcast news is based on the AUDIMUS.MEDIA system, a hybrid ANN/HMM system with multiple stream decoding. A 22.08% Word Error Rate (WER) was achieved in a Spanish Broadcast News task, which is comparable to other international state of the art systems. Parallel normalized texts from European Parliament database were used to train the SMT system from Spanish to Portuguese. Preliminary non-exhaustive human evaluation showed a fluency of 3.74 and sufficiency of 4.23.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying similar text passages plays an important role in many applications in NLP, such as paraphrase generation, automatic summarization, etc. This paper presents some experiments on detecting and clustering similar sentences of texts in Brazilian Portuguese. We propose an evalution framework based on an incremental and unsupervised clustering method which is combined with statistical similarity metrics to measure the semantic distance between sentences. Experiments show that this method is robust even to treat small data sets. It has achieved 86% and 93% of F-measure and Purity, respectively, and 0.037 of Entropy for the best case.",

In this work, we apply the ETL framework to Portuguese Part-of-Speech Taggging. We use two different corpora: Mac-Morpho and Tycho Brahae. ETL achieves the best results reported so far for Machine Learning based POS tagging of both corpora. ETL provides a new training strategy that accelerates transformation learning. For the Mac-Morpho corpus this corresponds to a factor of three speedup. ETL shows accuracies of 96.75% and 96.64% for Mac-Morpho and Tycho Brahae, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic transcription of telephone speech involves additional challenges compared to wideband data processing, mainly due to channel limitations and to particular characteristics of conversational telephone speech. While in TV speech recognition applications, such as automatic transcription of broadcast news, the presence of telephone data is nearly insignificant (less than 1 %), in most radio broadcast stations the presence of telephone speech grows significantly. Thus, transcription of telephone speech data deserves special attention in radio broadcast applications. In this work, we describe our initial efforts to tackle this particular problem. First, a telephone channel classifier is proposed to automatically detect telephone segments. Then, some strategies for increasing robustness of the automatic transcription system are investigated.",

In this paper we describe experiments that took as starting point the version of Esfinge that participated at the evaluation contest CLEF 2007. These experiments consisted in using different types of search patterns to retrieve relevant documents for questions, as this issue (document retrieval) was responsible for most of the errors occurred at CLEF 2007.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to parse multiple data types in Dialogue Systems. In its initial version, our spoken dialogue systems platform had a single and generic parser. However, when developing two new systems, the parser’s complexity increased and data types, like numbers, dates and free text messages, were not correctly interpreted. The solution we present to cope with these problems allows the system to rely on expectations about the flow of the dialogue based on the dialogue history and context. Because these expectations guide the parsing process, a positive impact is achieved in the recognition of objects in the user’s utterance. However, if the user fails to match the system’s expectations, for instance by changing the focus of the conversation, the system is still capable of understanding the input and recognizing the referred objects.",

        "Abstract": "In this work an adaptive modeling and spectral estimation scheme based on a dual Discrete Kalman Filtering (DKF) is proposed for speech enhancement. Both speech and noise signals are modeled by an autoregressive structure which provides an underlying time frame dependency and improves time-frequency resolution. The model parameters are arranged to obtain a combined state-space model and are also used to calculate instantaneous power spectral density estimates. The speech enhancement is performed by a dual discrete Kalman filter that simultaneously gives estimates for the models and the signals. This approach is particularly useful as a pre-processing module for parametric based speech recognition systems that rely on spectral time dependent models. The system performance has been evaluated by a set of human listeners and by spectral distances. In both cases the use of this pre-processing module has led to improved results.",

By considering a semi-spontaneous speech corpus, the presence of aspiration in BP voiceless stops is verified. Concerning velar and alveolar stops, the aspirated variant is more frequent than the unaspirated one. Through VOT measurements, the presence of slightly aspirated stops is pointed out in such an analysis. The distribution of the variants with respect to the stress position in the syllable is also assessed.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the majority of the text-to-speech synthesis systems that provide the most natural output are based on the selection and concatenation of variable size speech units chosen from an inventory of recordings. There are many different approaches to perform automatic speech segmentation. The most used are based on (Hidden Markov Models) HMM [1,2,3] or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [4], though Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [3,4,5] based algorithms are also popular. Techniques involving speaker adaptation of acoustic models are usually more precise, but demand larger amounts of training data, which is not always available.\nIn this work we compare several phonetic segmentation tools, based in different technologies, and study the transition types where each segmentation tool achieves better results. To evaluate the segmentation tools we chose the criterion of the number of phonetic transitions (phone borders) with an error below 20ms when compared to the manual segmentation. This value is of common use in the literature [6] as a majorant of a phone error. Afterwards, we combine the individual segmentation tools, taking advantage of their differentiate behavior accordingly to the phonetic transition type. This approach improves the results obtained with any standalone tool used by itself. Since the goal of this work is the evaluation of fully automatic tools, we did not use any manual segmentation data to train models. The only manual information used during this study was the phonetic sequence.",

        "Abstract": "Up-to-date language modeling is recognized to be a critical aspect of maintaining the level of performance for a speech recognizer over time for most applications. In particular for applications such as transcription of broadcast news and conversations where the occurrence of new words is very frequent, especially for highly inflected languages like the European Portuguese. An unsupervised adaptation approach, which dynamically adapts the active vocabulary and language model during a multi-pass speech recognition process, is presented. Experimental results confirmed the adequacy of the proposed approaches. Experiments were carried out for a European Portuguese Broadcast News transcription system with the best preliminary results yielding a relative reduction of 65.2% in OOV word rate and 6.6% in WER.",

        "Abstract": "Mathematic equations are, of necessity, a must in any mathematic textbooks but also in physics, communications and, in general, in any technology related texts. Furthermore, their usage in Digital Talking Books (DTB)[1] can be eased if its corresponding counterpart in both text and/or spoken forms can be automatically generated. Therefore, an automatic system to translate or convert them into text and latter to speech is needed to broaden the scope of the DTBs.\nDTBs are based on different types of data, structured according to some standard. They also require a player or browser that allows users to navigate, to index and to retrieve information (text, sound, images, etc.). The player was developed using a model based framework for adaptive multi-modal environments [2]. Besides supporting the features described in the DTB standard, the player introduces features complementing the synchronized presentation of text and audio, such as: addition of content related images; variable synchronization units, ranging from word to paragraph; annotation controlled navigation; definition of new reading paths; adaptation of the visual elements; behavioral adaptation reflecting user interaction, amongst others.",

        "Abstract": "IdSay is a Question Answering system for Portuguese that participated at QA@CLEF 2008 with a baseline version (IdSayBL). Despite the encouraging results, there was still much room for improvement. The participation of six systems in the Portuguese task, with very good results either individually or in an hypothetical combination run, provided a valuable source of information. We made an analysis of all the answers submitted by all systems to identify their strengths and weaknesses. We used the conclusions of that analysis to guide our improvements, keeping in mind the two key characteristics we want for the system: efficiency in terms of response time and robustness to treat different types of data. As a result, an improved version of IdSay was developed, including as the most important enhancement the introduction of semantic information. We obtained significantly better results, from an accuracy in the first answer of 32.5% in IdSayBL to 50.5% in IdSay, without degradation of response time.",

The aim is to assess whether the most accurate stemmers are also the ones that bring the biggest gain in Information Retrieval. Our results show that some kind of correlation does exist, but it is not as strong as one might have expected.",

We use the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) framework to learn how to translate from complex to simplified sentences. Given a parallel corpus of original and simplified texts, aligned at the sentence level, we train a standard SMT system and evaluate the “translations” produced using both standard SMT metrics like BLEU and manual inspection. Results are promising according to both evaluations, showing that while the model is usually overcautious in producing simplifications, the overall quality of the sentences is not degraded and certain types of simplification operations, mainly lexical, are appropriately captured.",

Considering our whole set of simplification rules, we discuss and compare two different orders in which to apply them: empirical and hierarchical.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, we apply and evaluate a machine-learning-based system to Portuguese clause identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first machine-learning-based approach to this task. The proposed system is based on\nEntropy Guided Transformation Learning\n. In order to train and evaluate the proposed system, we derive a clause annotated corpus from the\nBosque\ncorpus of the\nFloresta Sintá(c)tica Project\n– an European and Brazilian Portuguese treebank. We include part-of-speech (POS) tags to the derived corpus by using an automatic state-of-the-art tagger. Additionally, we use a simple heuristic to derive a phrase-chunk-like (PCL) feature from phrases in the Bosque corpus. We train an extractor to this sub-task and use it to automatically include the PCL feature in the derived clause corpus. We use POS and PCL tags as input features in the proposed clause identifier. This system achieves a\nF\nβ\n= 1\nof 73.90, when using the golden values of the PCL feature. When the automatic values are used, the system obtains\nF\nβ\n= 1\n= 69.31. These are promising results for a first machine learning approach to Portuguese clause identification. Moreover, these results are achieved using a very simple PCL feature, which is generated by a PCL extractor developed with very little modeling effort.",

        "Abstract": "Considerable attention has been given to the problem of Multiword Expression (MWE) identification and treatment, for NLP tasks like parsing and generation, to improve the quality of results. Statistical methods have been often employed for MWE identification, as an inexpensive and language independent way of finding co-occurrence patterns. On the other hand, more linguistically motivated methods for identification, which employ information such as POS filters and lexical alignment between languages, can produce more targeted candidate lists. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strenghts of different sources of information using a machine learning algorithm to produce more robust and precise results. Automatic evaluation on gold standards shows that the performance of our hybrid method is superior to the individual results of statistical and alignment-based MWE extraction approaches for Portuguese and for English. This method can be used to aid lexicographic work by providing a more targeted MWE candidate list.",

We consider that the usual semantic reasoners of natural language systems face difficulties in capturing this knowledge, due mainly to the lack of linguistic-semantic resources that support reasoning of this nature. This paper presents a new linguistic resource that expresses semantic-inferentialist knowledge for the Portuguese language – InferenceNet.Br – containing a base of concepts and a base of sentence patterns. These bases provide content for a top layer of semantic reasoning in natural language systems, where semantic relations are considered according to their roles in inferences, as premises or conclusions. This linguistic resource was used in a system for extracting information about crime, and the results of this proof of concept are discussed.",

We quantify the extent to which verb synonymy information in four resources overlaps, and we quantify how much novelty each resource in comparison to the others. We demonstrate that the four resources vary\nsignificantly\nin respect to verb synonymy information. Also, we show that by merging the four resources we can obtain a more comprehensive verb thesaurus. Finally, we suggest that resource merging may actually be required in order to avoid\nperformance\nand\nevaluation bias\nthat arise from coverage problems when using only one of these resources.",

This lack of corpora does not allow an extensive and deep research on continuous speech recognition systems for BP. In this work, we present a baseline system for continuous speech recognition for BP and its results using the West Point Brazilian Portuguese Corpus. In addition to the results, the resources developed to build the system are made available for continuing the research on such systems for BP.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we investigate parameters related to voice quality in European Portuguese (EP) emotional speech. Our main objectives were to obtain, to our knowledge for the first time, values for the parameters commonly contemplated in acoustic analyses of emotional speech and investigate if there is any difference for EP relative to the results obtained for other languages. A small corpus contemplating five emotions (joy, sadness, despair, fear, cold anger) and neutral speech produced by a professional actor was used. Parameters investigated include fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer and Harmonic Noise Ratio. In general, results were in accordance with the consulted literature regarding F0 and HNR. For jitter and shimmer our results were, in certain aspects, similar to the ones reported in a study of emotional speech for Spanish, another Latin language. From our analyses, and taking into consideration the reduced size of our corpus and the use of an actor as informant, no clear EP characteristic emerged, except for a possible, needing confirmation, difference regarding joy, with values similar to neutral speech.",

        "Abstract": "The prosodic prediction phenomenon concerns the possibility of a listener to predict what will be said, following the melodic modulation used for the initial part of a full sentence. This prediction concerns the semantic value and/or the syntactic relations in the sentence. The existence of that phenomenon was confirmed for Brazilian Portuguese, considering the relations between main clauses and subordinate adverbial clauses. Using the speech resynthesis process, it was possible to identify the specific fundamental frequency and durational behavior responsible for the predictive value in the main clauses. The implementation of an algorithm which considers that predictive phenomenon in a speech synthesis system will produce more natural final auditory results.",

While semi-automatic and automatic GTP approaches for Portuguese continue to achieve steady gains, such algorithms do not take morphology into account, despite a growing need to do so, based in part on the recent spelling reform. This paper presents a pilot study in the development of the Portuguese Unisyn Lexicon (LUPo) for assessing the role of morphological information in the generation of high-quality pronunciation lexica for regional variants of Portuguese. Some problematic orthographic contexts are identified, along with the associated difficulties that arise when morphology is left out of the equation. Expanding from known issues that affect Portuguese GTP systems, new orthographic contexts stemming from the recent spelling reform are addressed.",

        "Abstract": "Portuguese\n-mente\nending adverbs constitute a large, morphologically homogenous, but syntactically and semantically diverse lexical set. When coordinated, the first adverb loses the adverbial suffix and takes the shape of the base adjective, in the feminine-singular form. This raises the issue of its part-of-speech (POS) classification (adverb or adjective?), but especially its adequate parsing, since it may then be incorrectly analyzed as a modifier of a preceding noun. However, the POS tagging can not be adequately performed prior to some minimal syntactic analysis. The size of the lexicon involved (more than 7,000 adverbs) and the scarcity of instances, even in large corpora, make it ineffective to leave only for the POS tagger the task of solving this adjective/reduced adverbial form ambiguity. This paper proposes an integrated solution, where a rule-base disambiguating module and a POS statistical tagger combine to produce more accurate tagging and better parsing results to this non-trivial empirical problem. The system was evaluated on a large-sized corpus.",

This study aims to contribute to the characterization of the language of children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) in regard to morphology and syntax (morphosyntactic classes, most frequent words, use of personal pronouns, inflections of verbs: tense and person and syntactic structure). The four selected children, diagnosed with ASD, were recorded during activities that promoted speech. The records were transcribed and processed by PALAVRAS parser. The more frequent morphosyntactic classes detected were verbs and names. The most used determinants were the definite articles and, as far as adverbs are concerned, the most frequently used ones were adverbs of place. The syntactic structures were simple and short. The automated tools used for processing and analysis proved to be extremely functional and practical, with fast and effective results, opening the possibility of its usage for evaluation purposes in speech therapy practice.",

Since not all of these are SVCs, the candidates are ranked and filtered in a second, monolingual step based on association statistics. We discuss two parametrisations of our procedure for a high-precision and a high-recall setting. In our experiments, these parametrisations achieve a maximum precision of 91% and a maximum recall of 86%, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents the evaluation of a set of heuristics to improve the quality of extracted terms from an annotated domain corpus written in Portuguese. The proposed heuristics start from part-of-speech and grammatical functional annotation of texts, identifying nouns and noun phrases that are the best candidates to be considered terms of the domain. These nouns and noun phrases are submitted to a set of approximative rules (heuristics) that may either discard some, accept others (removing words or not), or even discover implicit terms that can be inferred. The effectiveness of these heuristics is verified through a corpus experiment, on the basis of a reference list for which usual metrics are computed.",

Starting from a simple document, we can reach a set of temporally annotated segments, which enables the establishment of relationships between words and time. This temporally enriched information is then placed into an Information Retrieval system. This work represents a step forward for Portuguese language processing, with notorious lack of tools. Its main novelty is temporal segmentation of texts. Even with target application in temporal aware Information Retrieval, the described software tools can be used in other application scenarios.",

However, bases with Portuguese-language content are still incipient. In this paper we present the process of inclusion of the InferenceNet – the first resource with common sense and inferentialist knowledge in Portuguese language – on the LOD. Our main goal is to leverage the use and development of Semantic Web applications by content producers in Portuguese language. We develop and evaluated a platform, called\nSemWidgets\n, for the creation and execution of widgets able to access and reason over InferenceNet and the open linked data, like DBPedia, Yago, and Article Search API of the New York Times.",

However evidence also indicates that they can take wide scope over coordinated verbs, a property which entails that syntax can have access to the internal structure of words. To account for the mismatch between the morphological and syntactic properties of weak object pronouns in BP, we propose a mapping algorithm, formulated within LFG, that allows morphological sequences to be mapped onto more than one phrase-structure node.",

        "Abstract": "Feature generation is a difficult, yet highly necessary, subtask of machine learning modeling. Usually, it is partially solved by a domain expert that generates complex and discriminative feature templates by conjoining the available basic features. This is a limited and expensive way to obtain feature templates and is recognized as a modeling bottleneck. In this work, we propose an automatic method to generate feature templates for structured learning algorithms. The method receives as input the training dataset with basic features and produces a set of feature templates by conjoining basic features that are highly discriminative together. We denote this method\nentropy guided\nsince it is based on the conditional entropy of local decision variables given the feature values. We illustrate our approach on the Portuguese dependency parsing task and report on experiments with the Bosque corpus. We show that the entropy-guided templates outperform the manually built templates used by MSTParser, which was the best performing system on the Bosque corpus up to now. Furthermore, our approach allows an effortless inclusion of two new basic features that automatically generate additional templates. As a result, our system achieves a per-token accuracy of 92.66%, what represents a reduction by more than 15% on the previous smallest error rate for Portuguese dependency parsing.",

The problem of automatically generating the stems, i.e. the sentences that serve as basis to this type of question, has been studied mostly for English, and it remains a challenge for a language as morphologically rich as European Portuguese (EP), for which additional data scarcity problems arise. To address this problem, a supervised classification technique is used to model a classifier that decides whether a given sentence is suitable to be used as a stem in a\ncloze\nquestion. The major focus is put in the feature engineering task, describing both the development of new criteria, and the adaptation to EP of features already explored in the literature. The resulting classifier filters out inadequate stems, allowing experts to build and personalize their instruction focusing on a set of potentially good sentences.",

We evaluated the proposed approach using a collection of Portuguese news articles from which the geographic entity names were extracted and then manually mapped to concepts in a geospatial ontology covering the territory of Portugal. The results suggest that using semantic similarity to disambiguate toponyms in text produces good results, in comparison with a baseline method.",

        "Abstract": "In the natural language processing (NLP) scenario, Brazilian Portuguese (and Portuguese in general) still suffers from the lack of good quality base tools (e.g. parsers) and resources (e.g. annotated corpora). Corpora annotated with semantic information is particularly scarce and is a very costly resource to be produced manually. In order to provide some help to mend that situation, this paper presents an automatic hyponymy identification method for Brazilian Portuguese texts. The proposed method uses lexical and syntactic data alongside common sense information obtained from the Brazilian Open Mind Common Sense project (OMCS-Br). The results obtained so far are compatible with previous work and encourage other directions for further research.",

        "Abstract": "Currently there are increasingly more private and academic publications in the form of digital content on the Internet making extremely difficult to extract and maintain the content information manually. Normally, these tasks follow approximations based on natural language processing. This paper presents a preliminary approach for obtaining a semantic role labeler for Portuguese, a little explored aspect of natural language processing for this language. The approach was evaluated for the 3 most frequent semantic roles (relation, subject and object) with a subset of Bosque 8.0 corpus. The same approach was applied to an English corpus – the CONLL’2004 one and its results were compared to the ones obtained on the CONLL’2004 shared task. At the same time it presents BosqueUE, a Portuguese corpus for semantic role labeling that can be the basis material for future research in the area. This corpus has the same format as the CONLL’2004 one, facilitating multi-language evaluations.",

For Brazilian Portuguese, recent projects in lexical semantics are about to provide the necessary computational resources for research in this area. However, the amount of annotated data provided is not significant enough for successful supervised learning. Hence, we propose to use a semi-supervised approach capable of taking advantage of both annotated and unannotated data available. In this paper, we outline the methodology for the development of this SRL system, the same as the benchmark to be used to test its performance.",

Starting from publicly-availabe language resources, the identification of human adjectives is performed through the combination of a linguistic-based strategy, for extracting human adjective candidates from corpora, and machine learning for filtering the human adjectives from the candidate list. We then create a graph of the synonymic relations among the human adjectives, which is built from multiple open thesauri. The graph provides distance features for training a model for polarity assignment. Our initial evaluation shows that this method produces results at least as good as the best that have been reported for this task.",

        "Abstract": "This study explores the use of machine learning in case law search in electronic trials. We clustered case law documents, automatically generating classes to a categorizer. These classes are used when a user uploads new documents to an electronic trial. We selected the algorithm TClus, created by Aggarwal, Gates and Yu, removing its document/group discarding features and adding a cluster division feature. We introduced a new paradigm “bag of terms and law references” instead of “bag of words” by generating attributes using a law domain thesaurus to detect legal terms and using regular expressions to detect law references. We clustered a case law corpus. The results were evaluated with the Relative Hardness Measure (RH) and the\n\\(\\bar{\\rho}\\)\n-Measure (RHO). The results were tested both with Wilcoxon’s Signed-ranks Test and Count of Wins and Losses Test to determine their significance. The categorization results were evaluated by human specialists. We compared true/false positives against document similarity with the centroid, cluster size, quantity and type of the attributes in the centroids and cluster cohesion. The article also discusses attribute generation and its implications to the classification results.",

In order to retrieve the types of products that are mostly purchased or viewed by a sample of consumers, we extract product titles displayed at the pages browsed by the monitored sample. Then, the collected titles are used as input to an automatic classification process that aims to assign each product to a suitable category and brand. We introduce a graph-based classifier that explores the relation between the categories and brands to be determined and is built from a supervised training set. We will show that the classifier was able to obtain good results, improving a Bayesian technique and allowing a further analysis of the considered market.",

Unlike these other linguistic resources, InferenceNet.Br allows representation of more expressive relationships between concepts, permitting to characterize premises or conclusions of these relationships. However, the integration between InferenceNet.Br with other linguistic resources is not possible directly. In order to settle this problem, in this paper we present a mapping of the knowledge bases of InferenceNet.Br to the Description Logic\n\\({\\textit{DL-Lite}_{\\mathcal{A}}}\\)\n, which is a fragment of OWL. As we know, OWL is a standard language designed to facilitate machine interpretability of Web content, through explicitly representation of the meaning of concepts in vocabularies and relationships between them. By doing this, we provide a connection between InferenceNet.Br and resources as WordNet and ConceptNet, since there are some efforts to link them to OWL.",

Currently, data have been acquired from one native speaker of European Portuguese. The speech corpus was primarily designed to investigate nasal vowels in a wide range of phonological contexts, but also includes examples of other EP sounds. The RT-MRI protocol developed for the acquisition of the data is detailed. Midsagittal and oblique images were acquired with a frame rate of 14 frames/s, resulting in a temporal resolution of 72 ms. Different image processing tools (automatic and semi-automatic) applied for inspection and analysis of the data are described. We demonstrate the potential of this database and processing techniques with some illustrative examples of Portuguese nasal vowels, taps, trills and laterals.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, an articulatory characterization of the palatal lateral is provided, using MRI images of the vocal tract acquired during the production of /L/ by several speakers of European Portuguese. The production of this sound involves: a complete linguo-alveolopalatal closure; inward lateral compression of the tongue and a convex shape of the posterior tongue body, allowing airflow around the sides of the tongue; large cross-sectional areas in the upper pharyngeal and velar regions. The lengths and area functions derived from MRI are analysed and used to model the articulatory-acoustic relations involved in the production of /L/. The results obtained in the first simulations show that the vocal-tract model (VTAR) is reasonably able to estimate the frequencies of the first formants and zeros. The lateral channels combined with the supralingual cavity create pole-zero clusters around and above F3, in the frequency range of 2-4.5 kHz.",

Eleven parameters were automatically extracted from 44 pairs of audiofiles yielding 11-size difference vectors. The parameters include speech rate, duration-related stress group rate, prominence and prosodic boundary strength, f\n0\npeak rate, as well as the coupling strength between underlying syllable and stress group oscillators. The 11-parameter difference vectors were used to infer the perceptual differences identified by a group of 10 listeners who judged the same 44 pairs of audiofiles . The results indicate that duration-related prominence or prosodic boundary rate and speech rate, taken together, predict up to 71 % of the response variance. To a minor extent, prominence/boundary strength mean and non-prominent VV unit rate predict up to 60 % of the response variance when combined with prominence or prosodic boundary rate.",

The duration measures necessary for the biomechanical model were extracted from an extensive EP speech production database, recorded for this aim. The same database was used to generate realistic voicing extinction contours for the perceptual continuum. To assess the realistic accuracy of the biomechanically generated stimuli, we compared the biomechanical stimuli set to linear interpolation between articulatory targets, traditionally used for speech synthesis.",

        "Abstract": "Automatic phonetic transcription tools usually perform phonetic transcriptions directly from orthographic representations. Although these approaches often achieve good results, theoretical studies suggest that including morphophonological knowledge allows those systems to improve their performance. Following this idea, we developed a tool which first obtains an underlying representation of each word, using small lexica and dedicated lemmatizers. For each representation, a phonological derivation generates the phonetic transcription by applying linguistically motivated rules. Since most of these rules are added as optional parameters, the system permits to generate dialect-specific transcriptions. This system is not only a grapheme-to-phone tool, but it also obtains phonological representations and evaluates several linguistic processes occurring during the derivation. Preliminary experiments emulating a phonological system of Galician (using as input words spelled in European Portuguese) show that the underlying representation of most words can be obtained using small lexica and also that the derivation produces high-quality phonetic transcriptions.",

        "Abstract": "The C-ORAL-BRASIL is a Brazilian Portuguese spontaneous speech corpus, representative of the state of Minas Gerais diatopy (primarily from the capital city, Belo Horizonte,metropolitan area). The corpus was compiled following the same architecture and segmentation criteria adopted by the C-ORAL-ROM [1] as well as its alignment software, the WinPitch [2]. The corpus comprises 139 informal speech texts, 208,130 words, 21:08:52 hours of recording (6.1 GB wav files). The mean word number per text is 1,500. The recordings were carried out with high resolution, non-invasive wireless equipment, generally with clip-on, monodirectional microphones, and a mixer whenever there were more than two interactants, in a few occasions omnidirectional microphones were used. The texts are transcribed following the CHAT format [3], implemented for prosodic annotation [4]. The main goals for the corpus architecture are the documentation of the diaphasic and diastratic variations in Brazilian Portuguese speech.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces a European Portuguese speech database containing spoken material recorded from children. The need for such database arose from the need of train phone models for the development of a computer aided speech therapy system. Articulatory disorders affect a significant number of children in pre-school age. We propose a system intended to assist and reinforce the conventional speech therapy programs. Through the systematic use of games, it learns the phones where the child has more difficulty to pronounce. The child is then taken to train the production of those phones by playing games. Another interest of a children speech database is that accurate children’s phone recognition is only possible using training data that reflects the population of users. It is a difficult task due to the high pitch of children’s speech.",

In contrast to languages such as English, there are few specific resources for Brazilian Portuguese. This work describes efforts aiming to decrease such gap. Baseline acoustic models for Brazilian Portuguese were built using the CMU Sphinx toolkit and public domain resources: speech corpora, phonetic dictionary and language model. Experiments were carried on for dictation and grammar tasks and the obtained results can be used to support further researches. Part of the trained acoustic models and a reference speech corpus were made publicly available.",

Fishervoice performs two-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (2D-PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to project the data into a discriminative subspace. After this transformation the speech utterances are transformed into supervectors and classified by means of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experiments performed on KALAKA-2 database, which includes speech in Spanish, Catalan, English, Basque, Galician and Portuguese, show that the Fishervoice-SVM system achieves good identification results while reducing dramatically the number of features needed to represent the speech utterances.",

Our proposal consists in the use of topic-related additional information sources to contextualize the information of the main input source, improving the estimation of the most important passages. We analyse the impact of using as additional information both the full topic-related stories and just the passages from those stories that are closer to the passages of the input source to be summarized. A multi-document summarization framework, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), provides the means to assess the relevant content. To minimize the influence of speech-related problems, we explore several term weighting strategies. Evaluation is performed using an information-theoretic evaluation measure, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, that does not need reference summaries.",

In this work we study the importance of accent variability for three broad varieties of Portuguese: African Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese.

The idea is to explore the results from a previous experiment concerning the characterization of filled pauses and extensions, extending the analysis of such hesitation phenomena to large audio corpus. Daily news broadcasts of Portuguese television were segmented and labeled manually in terms of several speech styles, over a range of background environments. An automatic detection of filled pauses and extensions in this audio data allowed us to correlate the presence of hesitation events with segments of unprepared speech. Distinguishing unprepared speech from prepared speech is of considerable practical interest for audio segmentation, speech processing and linguistic research. The long-term objective of this work is to automatically segment all audio genres and speaking styles as well as identify prosodic and linguistic features of the speech segments.",

        "Abstract": "The acoustic models used by automatic speech recognisers are usually trained with speech collected from young to middle-aged adults. As the characteristics of speech change with age, such acoustic models tend to perform poorly on children’s and elderly people’s speech. In this study, we investigate whether the automatic age group classification of speakers, together with age group –specific acoustic models, could improve automatic speech recognition performance. We train an age group classifier with an accuracy of about 95% and show that using the results of the classifier to select age group –specific acoustic models for children and the elderly leads to considerable gains in automatic speech recognition performance, as compared with using acoustic models trained with young to middle-aged adults’ speech for recognising their speech, as well.",

        "Abstract": "This study intends to identify acoustic and phonetic characteristics of the speech of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients, usually manifesting hypokinetic dysarthria. A speech database has been collected from a control group and from a group of patients with similar PD severity, but with different degrees of hypokinetic dysarthria. First and second formant frequencies of vowels in continuous speech were analyzed. Several classifiers were built using phonetic features and a range of acoustic features based on cepstral coefficients with the objective of identifying hypokinetic dysarthria. Results show a centralization of vowel formant frequencies for PD speech, as expected. However, some of the features highlighted in literature for discriminating PD speech were not always found to be statistically significant. The automatic classification tasks to identify the most problematic speakers resulted in high precision and sensitivity by using two formant metrics simultaneously and in even higher performance by using acoustic dynamic parameters.",

The purpose of this work is to enhance a grapheme-to-phoneme system with a verb pronunciation system for both varieties of Portuguese, Brazilian (BP) and European (EP), given only its infinitive form. The most common verbs for BP and EP (1000 and 2600 respectively) constituted our database to test the pronunciation system. A detailed and systematic analysis of regular and non-regular pronunciation forms of the inflected verbs was performed, and an index of irregularity for verb pronunciation is proposed. A rule-based algorithm to pronounce all inflexions according to verb paradigms is also described. The defined paradigms are, with a high level of certainty, representative of all the verbs for Portuguese.",

The ratio between the keyword model likelihood and the generic (filler) model likelihood is used by the classifier to detect relevant peaks values that indicate keyword occurrences. We have changed the standard scheme of keyword spotting system to allow keyword detection in a single forward step. We propose a new log-likelihood ratio normalization to minimize the effect of word length on the classifier performance. Tests show the effectiveness of our normalization method against two other methods. Experiments were performed on continuous speech utterances of the Portuguese TECNOVOZ database (read sentences) with keywords of several lengths.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents JMorpher, a morphological parsing utility that is implemented in pure Java. It is apparently the first tool of this type that natively runs on Android mobile devices. JMorpher compiles a lexical transducer definition in the AT&T raw text format, of the type generated by Foma and other open source finite-state packages, into an internal Java representation which is drawn upon to parse input strings. Besides the API, JMorpher comprises of a simple graphical interface that allows the user to load a transducer file, type in some text and parse it. Results of an evaluation based on large Portuguese lexical transducers of different complexity degrees are provided. The implementation was shown to be very efficient on a desktop PC. Although, on an Android smartphone, JMorpher’s performance is much lower, it is still suited to the needs of NLP tasks in this environment.",

Modality is the expression of the speaker’s (or the subject’s) attitude towards the content of the sentences and may be marked with lexical clues such as verbs, adverbs, adjectives, but also by mood and tense. Here we focus exclusively on 9 verbal clues that are frequent in Portuguese and that may have more than one modal meaning. We use as our gold data set a corpus of 160.000 tokens manually annotated, according to a modality annotation scheme for Portuguese. We apply a machine learning approach to predict the modal meaning of a verb in context. This modality tagger takes into consideration all the features available from the parsed data (pos, syntactic and semantic). The results show that the tagger improved the baseline for all verbs, and reached macro-average F-measures between 35 and 81% depending on the modal verb and on the modal value.",

In this work, we tackle Portuguese POS tagging using a deep neural network that employs a convolutional layer to learn character-level representation of words. We apply the network to three different corpora: the original Mac-Morpho corpus; a revised version of the Mac-Morpho corpus; and the Tycho Brahe corpus. Using the proposed approach, while avoiding the use of any handcrafted feature, we produce state-of-the-art POS taggers for the three corpora: 97.47% accuracy on the Mac-Morpho corpus; 97.31% accuracy on the revised Mac-Morpho corpus; and 97.17% accuracy on the Tycho Brahe corpus. These results represent an error reduction of 12.2%, 23.6% and 15.8%, respectively, on the best previous known result for each corpus.",

        "Abstract": "Supervised methods for grammar induction depend on large manually annotated corpora, which is time consuming and needs linguistic expertise. Many languages do not have the necessary resources, and so have a lack of largely available hand-annotated data. This includes Portuguese. So good methods for unsupervised grammar induction are desired. Some models based on constituency are achieving promising results for English. We explore one of them, implementing a semi-supervised model and showing the results we get with the scarce resources we have at hand. With an f-score of 64.32% on around 2400 sentences of Historical Portuguese, it is the best result we know for unsupervised Portuguese parsing. We hope that new works on unsupervised grammar induction of Portuguese will be triggered, and more annotated corpora developed.",

However, efforts in recognizing, understanding and dealing with profanity do not share resources, namely, their dataset, which imposes duplication of effort and non-comparable results.\nWe here present a freely available dataset of 2500 messages from a popular Portuguese sports website. About 20% of the messages had profanity, thus we annotated 726 swear words, 510 of which were obfuscated by the authors. We also identified the most frequent profanities, and what methods, and combination of methods, people used to disguise their cursing.",

This methodology is based on existing compilations of proverbs, by exploring the regular syntactic structures that most proverbs present and intersecting syntactic structure with the lexical units of the proverbs. From the syntactic regularities we divided the data into 13 different classes. Finite-state automata is used to represent the regular patterns found in the classes.

On this context, we propose ECO, an approach for creating wordnets automatically from text – relation instances are extracted, synonymy clusters (synsets) are discovered, and the remaining relations are then attached to suitable synsets. This document also reports on the contents of Onto.PT, its comparison to other wordnets, and its evaluation.",

For Portuguese, there are some important studies on semantic role labeling (Salomão 2009; Scarton 2013; Duran and Aluisio 2011, 2012), which will be presented in the following sections, but there is still much to do in this field.",

The WaCky (Web-As-Corpus Kool Yinitiative) methodology has been used to build very large corpora (over a billion words each) for languages like English, Italian and German among others. In this paper we present the ongoing work on building\nbrWaC\n, a massive Brazilian Portuguese corpus crawled from\n.br\ndomains. At the moment, the crawling process and the PoS tagging are finished, resulting in a tokenized and lemmatized corpus of 3 billion words. Next step is parsing the whole corpus.",

The presented evaluation is based on the comparison with three other NER tools for Portuguese. The comparison is made observing Recall and Precision measures obtained by each tool over the HAREM corpus, a golden standard for NER for Portuguese texts. The experiments were initially conducted considering ten categories and then, considering a reduced number of categories. The results show that NERP CRF outperforms the others tools when sufficiently trained for four entity categories.",

Some works use all dates but others use only document creation or modification timestamps. However, no previous work explicitly focuses on the use of dates within in the document content to establish temporal relationships between words in the document. This work estimates these relationships through a temporal segmentation of the texts, exploring them to expand queries. It was achieved very promising results (13% improvement in Precision@15), especially for temporal aware queries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using temporal text segmentation to improve retrieval results.",

        "Abstract": "Causative verbs can assist in the identification of causative relations. Portuguese has a large number of verbs that would make the manual labelling of causative verbs an manually expensive task. This paper presents a classification strategy which uses the characteristics of causative verbs co-occurring with common nouns to classify Brazilian Portuguese verbs as either: causative or non-causative. The strategy constructs a graph where verbs extracted from text are nodes. The verbs are connected if the verbs co-occur with common nouns. The classification strategy uses the unique characteristics of links between: 1. causative verbs, 2. causative verbs and non-causative verbs and 3. non-causative verbs to predict a label (causative or non-causative) for unlabelled verbs. The proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline and supervised learning strategies.",

There have been a number of resources which have grouped together English verbs, for example VerbNet.

Several researchers and companies have developed software to help individuals with ASD developing those skills; however, there is a lack of applications in Portuguese that are tailored to the individual needs of each child. In this context, we present VITHEA-Kids, a platform where caregivers can create exercises and customize the interaction between each child and the platform. We also developed a module for the automatic generation of multiple choice exercises, meant to be integrated in VITHEA-Kids. We evaluated this work with caregivers (which provided promising indicators), with a child (ongoing upon thesis delivery) and we also evaluated the generation of incorrect answers in multiple choice exercises (achieving acceptance rates between 61.11 % and 92.22 %).",

        "Abstract": "Recent research shows that most Brazilian students have serious problems regarding their reading skills. The full development of this skill is key for the academic and professional future of every citizen. Tools for classifying the complexity of reading materials for children aim to improve the quality of the model of teaching reading and text comprehension. For English, Feng’s work [\n11\n] is considered the state-of-art in grade level prediction and achieved 74 % of accuracy in automatically classifying 4 levels of textual complexity for close school grades. There are no classifiers for nonfiction texts for close grades in Portuguese. In this article, we propose a scheme for manual annotation of texts in 5 grade levels, which will be used for customized reading to avoid the lack of interest by students who are more advanced in reading and the blocking of those that still need to make further progress. We obtained 52 % of accuracy in classifying texts into 5 levels and 74 % in 3 levels. The results prove to be promising when compared to the state-of-art work.",

Although it is a relevant task due to the increasing amount of on-line information in different languages, there are only baselines for (Brazilian) Portuguese, which apply machine-translation to obtain a monolingual input and superficial features for sentence extraction. We report our investigation on the application of\nconceptual frequency\nmeasure to build a summary in Portuguese from a bilingual cluster (Portuguese and English). The methods tackle two additional challenges: using Princeton WordNet for nouns annotation and applying MT to translate selected sentences in English to Portuguese. The experiments were performed using a\ncorpus\nof 20 clusters, and show that lexical-conceptual knowledge improves the linguistic quality and informativeness of extracts.",

We further improved the initial version of the EN-PT hybrid system by adding various modules to address the most frequently occurring errors in the initial system. In order to assess the improvements achieved by each of these dedicated modules, we compared all versions of our MT system automatically.

By comparing the syntactic structures of these texts in ST, PCT, and HT sides, we found that nearly 90 % MT outputs suffer structural inconsistency with poor translation qualities. Therefore, we discuss and finally propose a series of grammar rules to address the problem. We believe that this work could inspire both MT researchers and industries to boost the performance of Portuguese–Chinese MT systems.",

        "Abstract": "We present a study in the area of sentiment analysis of clients’ commentaries transcribed by assistants of a help-desk service of one Portuguese telecommunications company. We have adopted a lexicon-based approach to determine the polarity of the sentiment of each commentary, based on the so called\nopinion words\n. This task was by no means easy, as not many tools are available for the Portuguese language. The initial results with the off-the-shelf solutions were rather poor. This has motivated us to carry out a number of enhancements, including, for instance, enriching the given lexicon with\ndomain specific\nterms, formulating specific rules for negation and amplifiers. Automatic pruning of some of the lexicon terms has led to a significant improvement in performance. As our final system achieved a very good performance, our work should be of interest to others working on domain specific solutions for languages where ready-made solutions are not available.",

Thus, this work presents an open source pipeline to analyze the costumer’s opinion or sentiment in Twitter about products and services offered by Brazilian companies. The pipeline is based on General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) framework and the proposed hybrid method combines lexicon-based, supervised learning, and rule-based approaches.

Here, we describe the results of creating a unified environment, entitled Coh-Metrix-Dementia, based on a previous tool to analyze discourse, named Coh-Metrix-Port. After adding 25 new metrics for measuring syntactical complexity, idea density, and text cohesion through latent semantics, Coh-Metrix-Dementia extracts 73 features from narratives of normal aging (CTL), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients. This paper presents initial experiments in automatically diagnosing CTL, AD, and MCI patients from a narrative language test based on sequenced pictures and textual analysis of the resulting transcriptions. In order to train regression and classification models, the large set of features in Coh-Metrix-Dementia must be reduced in size. Three feature selection methods are compared. In our experiments with classification, it was possible to separate CTL, AD, and MCI with 0.817\n\\(F_1\\)\nscore, and separate CTL and MCI with 0.900\n\\(F_1\\)\nscore. As for regression, the best results for MAE were 0.238 and 0.120 for scenarios with three and two classes, respectively.",

Based on that principle, this paper presents a method for finding the set of compositional rules that best explain the\npositive\n,\nnegative\n, and\nneutral\nsemantic orientation (SO) of two-word phrases, in terms of the SO of its words. For instance, the phrase “\nfake contract\n” has a negative SO. A corpus was built for evaluating the proposed method and several experiences are reported. We also use the conditional probability as a reliability measure of the compositional rules. The reliability of the learned rules ranges from 60.44 % for verb-noun phrases to 100 % for adjective-adjective phrases.",

Doc2Vec achieved the best result overall on the skewed classes, but performed poorly over small and sampled configurations. RNTN achieved the best result on the over-sampled corpus.

        "Abstract": "Relation extraction is a subtask of information extraction that aims at obtaining instances of semantic relations present in texts. This information can be arranged in machine-readable formats, useful for several applications that need structured semantic knowledge. The work presented in this paper explores different strategies to automate the extraction of semantic relations from texts in Portuguese, Galician and Spanish. Both machine learning (distant-supervised and supervised) and rule-based techniques are investigated, and the impact of the different levels of linguistic knowledge is analyzed for the various approaches. Regarding domains, the experiments are focused on the extraction of encyclopedic knowledge, by means of the development of biographical relations classifiers (in a closed domain) and the evaluation of an open information extraction tool. To implement the extraction systems, several natural language processing tools have been built for the three research languages: From sentence splitting and tokenization modules to part-of-speech taggers, named entity recognizers and coreference resolution systems. Furthermore, several lexica and corpora have been compiled and enriched with different levels of linguistic annotation, which are useful for both training and testing probabilistic and symbolic models. As a result of the performed work, new resources and tools are available for automated processing of texts in Portuguese, Galician and Spanish.",

        "Abstract": "The task of Open Relation Extraction from texts faces many challenges, considering the required linguistic knowledge and the sophistication of the language processing techniques employed. This paper presents the extraction and structuring of open relations between named entities from Portuguese texts. We apply the Conditional Random Fields model for the extraction of relation descriptors between named entities belonging to Person, Place and Organisation categories. A 0.64 of F-measure was reached as a result. To make better sense of the output, we structure the extracted relation descriptors using mining configurations.",

        "Abstract": "Keyphrase\nassignment has often been confounded with\nkeyphrase\nextraction, since the basic hypothesis is that a\nkeyphrase\nof a text must be extracted from this text. Typically,\nkeyphrase\nextraction approaches use a training set restricted to textual terms, reducing the learning capabilities of any inductive algorithm. Our research investigates ways to improve the accuracy of the\nkeyphrase\nassignment systems for texts in Portuguese language by allowing classification algorithms to learn from non-textual terms as well. The basic assumption we have followed is that non-textual terms can be included into the training set by inference from an eventual semantic relationship with textual terms. In order to discover the latent relationship between non-textual and textual terms, we use deductive strategies to be applied in Portuguese common sense bases such as Wikipedia and InferenceNet. We show that algorithms that follow our approach outperform others that do not use the same methods introduced here.",

In this paper, we propose an EL approach whose main contribution is to make use of a knowledge base built by means of distributional similarity. More precisely, Wikipedia is transformed into a manageable database structured with similarity relations between entities. Our EL method is focused on a specific task, namely semantic annotation of documents by extracting those relevant terms that are linked to nodes in DBpedia/Wikipedia. The method is currently working for four languages. The Portuguese and English versions have been evaluated and compared against other EL systems, showing competitive range, close to the best systems.",

The resulting co-occurrence statistics is represented in\nlex-grams\n, that is, a synopsis of the syntactically-based co-occurrence patterns of a word distribution within a given\ncorpus\n. These\nlex-grams\nare obtained from a large-sized Portuguese\ncorpus\nprocessed by STRING [\n19\n] and are presented in a user-friendly way through a graphical interface.

        "Abstract": "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a Natural Language Processing task that enables the detection of events described in sentences and the participants of these events. For Brazilian Portuguese (BP), there are two studies recently concluded that perform SRL in journalistic texts. [\n1\n] obtained F1-measure scores of 79.6, using the PropBank.Br corpus, which has syntactic trees manually revised; [\n8\n], without using a treebank for training, obtained F1-measure scores of 68.0 for the same corpus. However, the use of manually revised syntactic trees for this task does not represent a real scenario of application. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of SRL on revised and non-revised syntactic trees using a larger and balanced corpus of BP journalistic texts. First, we have shown that [\n1\n]’s system also performs better than [\n8\n]’s system on the larger corpus. Second, the SRL system trained on non-revised syntactic trees performs better over non-revised trees than a system trained on gold-standard data.",

It is generally agreed upon that applying them to the variant other than their intended one results in a performance drop; however, very little research has measured it. We evaluated a POS tagger in a cross-variant setting under multiple combinations of word embeddings, train and test corpora, and found that (i) BP is easier than EP, (ii) word embeddings help increase tagger performance significantly, but not enough to close the accuracy gap in a cross-variant setting and (iii) embeddings generated from a corpus with both variants are useful in cross-variant scenarios. While we cannot generalize observations from POS tagging to any NLP task, this is an important first step for such evaluations.",

This paper presents the first experiments towards the exploitation of seven of those resources in the automatic creation of a large wordnet, where numerical scores are assigned to the inclusion of words in synsets and to the connection of synsets by semantic relations. Experiments confirm that a large wordnet can indeed be created and, to some extent, computed scores can be used as a confidence measure, which will enable the users to select only a portion of the resource, depending on the needs of their application on quantity and quality of lexical-semantic knowledge.",

        "Abstract": "The semantic annotation of corpora has an important role to play in ensuring that sentences occurring in natural language texts are correctly understood based on their intended context. Two examples of lexical semantic units that contribute to this knowledge are word senses – which allow words with multiple meanings to be understood based on the context in which they are used – and named entities – which can be disambiguated and linked back to the specific encyclopedic resources that describe them.\nIn this paper, we describe the construction of lexical semantically-annotated corpora for Portuguese, annotated with both word senses linked to senses in a Portuguese wordnet and named entities linked to Portuguese Wikipedia entries using DBpedia. The result is a gold-standard lexical semantically-annotated resource that is useful in supporting the training and evaluation of tools for the disambiguation of these lexical units in Portuguese.",

On the other hand, the Web is increasingly being used by researchers as a source of written content to build very large and rich corpora, in the Web as Corpus (WaC) initiative. This paper proposes a framework for automatic generation of large corpora classified by readability. It adopts a supervised learning method to incorporate a readability filter based in features with low computational cost to a crawler, to collect texts targeted at a specific reading level. We evaluate this framework by comparing a readability-assessed web crawled corpus to a reference corpus (Both corpora are available in\nhttp://www.inf.ufrgs.br/pln/resource/CrawlingByReadabilityLevel.zip\n.). The results obtained indicate that these features are good at separating texts from level 1 (initial grades) from other levels. As a result of this work two Portuguese corpora were constructed: the Wikilivros Readability Corpus, classified by grade level, and a crawled WaC classified by readability level.",

By comparing the syntactic and semantic affordances of a lexical unit in the source language with those shown by all lexical units evoking the same frame in a target language, the application suggests which of them is the best-fit translation equivalent. The application contributes to the purpose of bringing to scale the development of frame-based multilingual lexical databases. We discuss the current limitations of the application, especially those regarding entity nouns, and propose the use of ontologies and qualia structure as a means of enhancing machine translation for entity nouns.",

In order to populate our corpus, we relied on opinions from experts on Brazilian finance that are active on the Twitter application. From these experts, we extracted information from news websites that are used as answers in the corpus. Moreover, to effectively provide rankings of answers to questions, we employ novel word vector based similarity measures between short sentences (that accounts for both questions and Tweets). We validated our methods on a recently released dataset of similarity between short Portuguese sentences. Finally, we also discuss the effectiveness of our approach when used to rank answers to questions from real users.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, spell checking (or spelling correction systems) has regained attention due to the need of normalizing user-generated content (UGC) on the web. UGC presents new challenges to spellers, as its register is much more informal and contains much more variability than traditional spelling correction systems can handle. This paper proposes two new approaches to deal with spelling correction of UGC in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), both of which take into account phonetic errors. The first approach is based on three phonetic modules running in a pipeline. The second one is based on machine learning, with soft decision making, and considers context-sensitive misspellings. We compared our methods with others on a human annotated UGC corpus of reviews of products. The machine learning approach surpassed all other methods, with 78.0 % correction rate, very low false positive (0.7 %) and false negative rate (21.9 %).",

However, it is an extremely labor-intensive task. An automatic alignment tool has modules that depend on the language and, while there are many public resources for some languages (e.g., English and French), the resources for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) are still limited. This work describes the development of an automatic phonetic alignment tool for BP, consisting of grapheme-to-phone converter, syllabification system and HTK-based acoustic models. This aligner is implemented and freely distributed as a plug-in of Praat. Performance tests are presented, comparing the current proposal with an existing tool.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate the reading performance of children, human assessment is usually involved, where a teacher or tutor has to take time to individually estimate the performance in terms of fluency (speed, accuracy and expression). Automatic estimation of reading ability can be an important alternative or complement to the usual methods, and can improve other applications such as e-learning. Techniques must be developed to analyse audio recordings of read utterances by children and detect the deviations from the intended correct reading i.e. disfluencies. For that goal, a database of 284 European Portuguese children from 6 to 10 years old (1st–4th grades) reading aloud amounting to 20 h was collected in private and public Portuguese schools. This paper describes the design of the reading tasks as well as the data collection procedure. The presence of different types of disfluencies is analysed as well as reading performance compared to known curricular goals.",

For that, we defined a set of rhetorical categories that aim at modeling the structure of opinion articles produced in this specific context and used it to manually annotate a corpus. Results of the annotation experiment showed substantial agreement among the annotators and disagreements were settled using the majority vote to build a gold standard corpus. This corpus was then used to build automatic classifiers that assign one of the possible categories to each sentence of the opinion article. Experimental results regarding the classification were promising considering the model’s simplicity and the reduced number of training instances.",

In this paper, we present SMILLE for Portuguese, a system for detecting pedagogically relevant grammatical structures in raw texts. SMILLE’s rules for recognizing grammatical structures were evaluated in random sentences from three different genres, achieving an overall precision of 84%. The automatic recognition of pedagogically relevant grammatical structures can help teachers and course coordinators to better inform the choice of texts to be used in language courses, while also allowing for the analysis of grammar profiles for SLA. As a case study, we used SMILLE to analyze pedagogical material used in a Portuguese as foreign language course and to observe how the predominance of grammatical content in the texts is related to the described grammatical focus of the language levels.",

The goal of this paper is to describe and analyze this corpus in terms of the characteristics of annotated VMWEs in Brazilian Portuguese. First, we summarize and exemplify the criteria used to annotate VMWEs. Then, we analyze their frequency, average length, discontinuities and variability. We further discuss challenging constructions and borderline cases. We believe that this analysis can improve the annotated corpus and its results can be used to develop systems for automatic VMWE identification.",

Several other Natural Language Processing tasks may benefit from it, such as named entities recognition, relation extraction between named entities, summarization, sentiment analysis, among others. We propose a process for nominal coreference resolution in Portuguese, based on syntactic-semantic linguistic rules. Such rule models have been efficiently applied in other languages, such as: English, Spanish and Galician. They are useful when we deal with less resourceful languages, since the lack of sample-rich corpora may prevent accurate learning. We combine different levels of linguistic processing, using semantic relations as support, in order to infer referential relations between mentions. The proposed approach is the first model for Portuguese coreference resolution which uses semantic knowledge.",

Thus, Open IE area emerges to help the extraction of semantic relationships in a large number of texts written in a natural language from different domains. Although a semantic analysis does not guarantee complete accuracy in extracting relations, a pragmatic analysis becomes important on Open EI to identify additional meanings (unsaid) that goes beyond semantics in a text. Our work developed a method for Open Information Extraction to extract relations from texts written in Portuguese in a first pragmatic level. We stated that a first pragmatic level deals with inferential, contextual and intentional aspects. We evaluate our approach, and our results outstand the most relevant related work on comparing accuracy and minimality measures.",

By analyzing the comparisons, we observed relationships of inclusion, intersection and disjunction within each pair of LGs, which helped us to assemble those that yielded the best results. This approach was used in a case study on extraction of person names from texts written in Portuguese. We applied the enhanced grammar to the Gold Collection of the Second HAREM. The F-Measure obtained was 76.86, representing a gain of 6 points in relation to the state-of-the-art for Portuguese.",

        "Abstract": "Open information extraction (Open IE) is a task of extracting facts from a plain text without limiting the analysis to a predefined set of relationships. Although a significant number of studies have focused on this problem in the last years, there is a lack of available linguistic resources for languages other than English. An essential resource for the evaluation of Open IE methods is notably an annotated corpus. In this work, we present the challenges involved in the creation of a golden set corpus for the Open IE task in the Portuguese language. We describe our methodology, an annotation tool to support the task and our results on performing this annotation task in a small validation corpus.",

In the present work, we investigate different methods for associating relations extracted by Open IE systems with the semantic relations they describe by using word embedding models. The results presented in our experiments indicate that the methods are ill-suited for this problem and show that there is still a lot to research on the Relation Disambiguation in Portuguese.",

To this end, we first built a corpus of Facebook status updates labelled with the personality traits of their authors, from which we trained a number of computational models of personality recognition. The models include a range of alternatives ranging from a standard approach relying on lexical knowledge from the LIWC dictionary and others, to purely text-based methods such as bag of words, word embeddings and others. Results suggest that word embedding models slightly outperform the alternatives under consideration, with the advantage of not requiring any language-specific lexical resources.",

        "Abstract": "Text-image alignment is the task of aligning elements in a text with elements in the image accompanying it. Text-image alignment can be applied, for example, in news articles to improve clarity by explicitly defining the correspondence between regions in the article’s image and words or named entities in the article’s text. It can also be an useful step in many multimodal applications such as image captioning or image description/comprehension. In this paper we present the LinkPICS: an automatic aligner which combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques to explicitly define the correspondence between regions of an image (bounding boxes) and elements (words or named entities) in a text. LinkPICS performs the alignment of people and objects (or animals, vehicles, etc.) as two distinct processes. In the experiments present in this paper, LinkPICS obtained a precision of 97% in the alignment of people and 73% in the alignment of objects in articles in Portuguese from a Brazilian news site.",

        "Abstract": "Question Answering Systems is a field of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing that automatically answers questions posed by humans in a natural language. One of the main steps of these systems is the Question Classification, where the system tries to identify the type of question (i.e. if it is related to a person, time or a location) facilitate the generation of a precise answer. Machine learning techniques are commonly employed in tasks where the text is represented as a vector of features, such as bag–of–words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or word embeddings. However, the quality of results produced by supervised algorithms is dependent on the existence of a large, domain-dependent training dataset which sometimes is unavailable due to labor-intense of manual annotation of datasets. Normally, word embedding presents a related better performance on small training sets, while bag-of-words and TF-IDF presents better results on large training sets. In this work, we propose a hybrid model that combines TF-IDF and word embedding in order to provide the answer type to text questions using small and large training sets. Our experiments using the Portuguese language, using several different sizes of training sets, showed that the proposed hybrid model statistically outperforms bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embedding approaches.",

So far, the extant index tools in both the printed and digital newspaper versions are not sufficient to help users find information. Users must browse the entire newspaper to fulfill their needs or discover later on, after spending a considerable amount of energy, that the information they had been seeking is not available. We propose here to use state-of-the-art strategies for extracting named entities specifically for person names and, with an index of names, provide the user with an important tool to find names within newspaper pages. The state-of-the-art system considered used the Golden Collection of the First and Second HAREM, a reference for Named Entity Recognition systems in Portuguese, as training and test sets respectively. Furthermore, we created a new training dataset from the actual newspaper’s articles. In this case, we processed 100 articles of the newspaper and managed to correctly find 87.0% of the extant names and their respective partial citations.",

Impairment in spoken language can negatively affect the social development of these children. Some studies acknowledge that even with a delay in language, children with ASD can acquire speech as soon as an intervention is made early in their lives. This paper presents an application called ACA (Learning with Alternative Communication) that would help these children to acquire an essential linguistic repertoire for the accomplishment of their Daily Life Activities (ADLs). ACA is an Android application that uses alternative communication with voice synthesis, which was developed to help children within the autistic spectrum to identify objects, memorize their names, learn phonemes, visualize some morphological information related to some objects and also help them in the syllabic and pre-syllabic phases of the literacy process.",

        "Abstract": "Technologies, such as electromagnetic midsagittal articulography (EMA) and real-time magnetic resonance (RT-MRI), can contribute to improve our understanding of the static and dynamic aspects of speech, namely by providing information regarding which articulators are essential (critical) in producing specific sounds and how (gestures). Previous work has successfully demonstrated the possibility to determine critical articulators considering vocal tract data obtained from RT-MRI. However, these works have adopted a conservative approach by considering vocal tract representations analogous to the flash points obtained with EMA data, i.e., landmarks fixed over the articulators, e.g., tongue. To move towards a data-driven method able to determine gestural scores, e.g., driving articulatory speech synthesis, one important step is to move into a representation aligned with Articulatory Phonology and Task Dynamics. This article advances towards this goal by exploring critical articulators determination considering a vocal tract representation aligned with this framework is adopted and presents first results considering 50 Hz RTMRI data for two speakers of European Portuguese.",

        "Abstract": "The assessment of intonation, to which intonation verification belongs, has many applications, such as health-impaired people training – from individuals with Parkinson’s disease to children with Autism Spectrum Disorders – and second language learning. Most of the approaches that are found in the literature are based on intensive preprocessing of the audio signal and hand-crafted feature extraction methods, and most of those works do not tackle the particularities of the Portuguese language. In this paper, we present our work on intonation assessment, developed from a database of binarily-labelled Portuguese intonation imitation. This has been done using the set of Low Level Descriptors (LLDs) and eGeMAPS, both extracted with the openSMILE toolkit, and Problem-Agnostic Speech Encoder (PASE) features. We have taken the most informative feature subsets for prosody out of these. Distances between stimulus and imitation – the so-called similarity intonation scores – have been computed applying Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for different feature subsets, and have afterwards been used as input features of a binary classifier. Performance achieves up to 66.9% of accuracy in the test data set when considering only one feature set, and it increases up to 77.5% for a set of seven features.",

        "Abstract": "The development of reliable speech therapy computer tools that automatically classify speech productions depends on the quality of the speech data set used to train the classification algorithms. The data set should characterize the population in terms of age, gender and native language, but it should also have other important properties that characterize the population that is going to use the tool. Thus, apart from including samples from correct speech productions, it should also have samples from people with speech disorders. Also, the annotation of the data should include information on whether the phonemes are correctly or wrongly pronounced. Here, we present a corpus of European Portuguese children’s speech data that we are using in the development of speech classifiers for speech therapy tools for Portuguese children. The corpus includes data from children with speech disorders and in which the labelling includes information about the speech production errors. This corpus, which has data from 356 children from 5 to 9 years of age, focuses on the European Portuguese sibilant consonants and can be used to train speech recognition models for tools to assist the detection and therapy of sigmatism.",

        "Abstract": "Deep Learning models are considered state-of-the-art regarding Text-to-Speech, displaying very natural and realistic results. However, it is known that these machine learning methods usually require large amounts of data to operate properly. Due to this, an assessment of the system’s ability to generalize to different instances becomes relevant, specially when learning from small data sets to create new voices. This study describes the assessment of a deep learning approach to TTS for European Portuguese. We show that we can use transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a Tacotron-2 model to a specific voice, while preserving speaker identity, without requiring large amounts of data. We also perform a comparison between the developed model and a statistical parametric speech synthesizer enhanced by deep learning, concluding that Tacotron-2 provided an overall better word pronunciation, naturalness and intonation.",

This is the case of the Portuguese platform VITHEA, which provides remote access to automatic training sessions for aphasia rehabilitation. In VITHEA, patients’ answers to semantic confrontation exercises are validated using automatic speech recognition. Text-to-speech synthesis and a virtual agent are exploited to allow a natural multimodal interaction. While the effectiveness of the different technological components has been individually validated, there is a need for the assessment of the overall therapeutic platform. In this work, we report evaluation results of the complete therapeutic platform based on a survey collected from speech and language therapists. The results not only confirmed the significant usefulness of the platform for the treatment of aphasic patients, but also provided very relevant feedback that led to the introduction of additional features and to the development of similar solutions for other diseases\n.",

        "Abstract": "Most research on Lexical Simplification (LS) addresses non-native speakers of English, since they are numerous and easier to recruit for evaluating resources. Target audiences that are harder to deal with, such as children, are often underrepresented in literature, although simplifying a text for children could facilitate access to knowledge in a classroom setting, for example. This paper presents an improved version of SIMPLEX-PB, a public benchmarking dataset for LS that was subject to multiple rounds of manual annotation in order for it to accurately capture the simplification needs of underprivileged children. It addresses all limitations of the old SIMPLEX-PB: incorrectly generated synonyms for complex words, low coverage of synonyms, and the absence of reliable simplicity rankings for synonyms. The dataset was subjected to an enhancement on the number of synonyms for its target complex words (7,31 synonyms on average), and the simplicity rankings introduced were manually provided by the target audience itself – children between 10 and 14 years of age studying in underprivileged public institutions.",

        "Abstract": "Current approaches to the computational modelling of irony mostly address verbal irony and sarcasm, neglecting other productive types of irony, namely situational irony. The function of situational irony is to lay emphasis on (real or fictional) events that evoke peculiar and unexpected images, which usually create a comical effect on the audience. In this paper, we investigate the linguistic and rhetorical devices underlying this phenomenon in a corpus composed of farcical news headlines, aiming at its automatic recognition. Based on a thorough annotation study, we found that in news headlines unexpectedness is mainly achieved by combining terms from different conceptual domains (what we have called out-of-domain contrast). We then explored features for automatically identifying these semantic and pragmatic incongruities and evaluated their discriminating power in a corpus whose irony is expressed by means of out-of-domain contrast. The features explored in our experiments are globally effective in capturing this phenomenon, attaining a six percent improvement in terms of the F-Measure over a baseline that only considers lexical information. Moreover, we observed that the best features typically reported in the literature for identifying incongruity in sarcastic text are not relevant for detecting situational irony in farcical news, thus reinforcing the idea that these phenomena pose different challenges that require distinct modelling approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Official Gazettes are a rich source of relevant information to the public. Their careful examination may lead to the detection of frauds and irregularities that may prevent mismanagement of public funds. This paper presents a dataset composed of documents from the Official Gazette of the Federal District, containing both samples with document source annotation and unlabeled ones. We train, evaluate and compare a transfer learning based model that uses ULMFiT with traditional bag-of-words models that use SVM and Naive Bayes as classifiers. We find the SVM to be competitive, its performance being marginally worse than the ULMFiT while having much faster train and inference time and being less computationally expensive. Finally, we conduct ablation analysis to assess the performance impact of the ULMFiT parts.",

We use texts from the NLI-PT dataset corresponding to five native languages: Chinese, English, German, Italian, and Spanish. We include the same L1s as in previous works, and more texts per language. We investigate the impact of different lexical representations, the use of syntactic dependencies and the performance of diverse classification methods. Our best model achieves an accuracy of 0.66 including lexical features, and of 0.61 excluding them. Both results improve previous works on NLI for L2 Portuguese.",

Our data comes from social network, in order to make better sense and analysis of the information provided we consider the IATE (InterActive Terminology for Europe) regarding its crime related sub-domain. The alignment of this terminology to an ontology is a further step towards enriching the semantics of the data. We evaluate a recently proposed domain top ontology matcher (based on Wordnet-SUMO previous alignment) to the task of aligning this IATE sub-domain to SUMO, a general purpose top ontology. Another aspect to explore is the use of multi-linguality in the disambiguation problem itself, as in the case of “alvo” (aim as target and not goal) which becomes more clear in the Portuguese than the English version.",

        "Abstract": "The generation of synthetic parallel corpora through the automatic translation of a monolingual text, a process known as back-translation, is a technique used to augment the amount of parallel data available for training Machine Translation systems and is known to improve translation quality and thus mitigate the lack of data for under-resourced language pairs. It is assumed that, when training on synthetic parallel data, the original monolingual data should be used at the target side and its translation at the source side, an assumption to be assessed. The contributions of this paper are twofold. We investigate the viability of using synthetic data to improve Neural Machine Translation for Portuguese-Chinese, an under-resourced pair of languages for which back-translation has yet to demonstrate its suitability. Besides, we seek to fill another gap in the literature by experimenting with synthetic data not only at the source side but also, alternatively, at the target side. While demonstrating that, when appropriately applied, back-translation can enhance Portuguese-Chinese Neural Machine Translation, the results reported in this paper also confirm the current assumption that using the original monolingual data at the source side outperforms using them at the target side.",

This article examines the use of Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) as a method for automatic fake news detection. We evaluate the proposed models in the Brazilian Portuguese fake news parallel corpus Fake.Br using its original full text, and also in the truncated version. We run the HAN varying the size of word embedding from 100 to 600, and by maintaining and removing the stop words. This method achieved an accuracy of 97% for full texts using the word embedding size of 600 from GloVe. However, when comparing running this method for truncated texts, this method presents similar results (90% accuracy) to the baseline established by the simple machine learning methods presented in the original presentation work of the Fake.Br (89% accuracy). Overall, keeping or removing stop words and varying the size of the word embeddings also shows a negligible advantage.",

It is an application that reads customers emails from a general entrance email box sent to Banco do Brasil. Afterwards, it classifies the emails by their content (message body) and forwards them to other four Specific Email Boxes (SEBs), according to the demand or business of the customer found in the email body. The application was created to automate the screening process of an email box that receives up to 4,000 emails per day. Before ACE existed, the screening process was manually done by up to eight business assistants (employees) of the company. When the application started being used, the number of employees working on the General Email Box (GEB) was reduced to one or two. They are still necessary because ACE does not classify all emails received in the GEB. The machine learning algorithm used in this task is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. The efficiency of the system is assured by a curation process coupled with a self-feeding strategy. The F1-Score of the system is 0.9048.",

The system relies on a corpus to build a supervised model, and employs the same features regardless of the task. Our experiments cover two types of features, contextualized embeddings and lexical features, which we evaluate separately and in combination. The model is derived from a voting strategy on an ensemble of distinct regressors, on similarity measurement, or calibrated classifiers, on entailment detection. Applying such system to other languages mainly depends on the availability of corpora, since all features are either multilingual or language independent. We obtain competitive results on a recent Portuguese corpus, where our best result is obtained by joining embeddings with lexical features.",

        "Abstract": "Besides alternative text-based forms, emojis became highly common in social media. Given their importance in daily communication, we tackled the problem of emoji prediction in Portuguese social media text. We created a dataset with occurrences of frequent emojis, used as labels, and then compared the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms with neural networks when predicting them. Either considering five or ten of the most popular emojis, an LSTM neural network clearly outperformed Naive Bayes in the latter task, with F1-scores of 60% and 52%, respectively, against 33% and 23%.",

ALiB’s first publication covered 25 capitals of Brazil into the volume 1 and 2 of the Atlas. Taking into account the semantic-lexical map from ALiB, this paper analyzes the vitality of the ALiB terms through Twitter. Two methods are proposed: one lexical that deals with the lexical variations of ALiB terms on Twitter, and the other reflects the disambiguation of Twitter terms with similar meaning to those of the project. The results highlight that some terms are no longer used or not employed in a social network. On the other hand, some terms cataloged by ALiB continue to be used by Brazilians even in social media.",

Once the spread of fake news reached a critical point, relevant initiatives to fight them have emerged. In this paper, we adapt from English a knowledge graph-based method for fact-checking and propose a new one based on Google search, following content-based strategies for tackling deception in Portuguese, differently from what has been previously done in linguistic-based approaches. Our results are promising and indicate new ways to deal with the deceptive content detection issue.",

The objective of this paper is to describe an approach to analyze information expressed in social networks to help the recommendation of urban resources. This process considers different structured and unstructured features like resource’s location, reviews polarity, and user profile reliability. Therefore, we use text and Web mining techniques to extract those features and then apply traditional recommendation algorithms considering different combinations to identify if they provide better results. Results were compared, and we found that for neighborhood algorithms, the proposed approach presented better results when compared to traditional methods.",

        "Abstract": "Research on question answering tools over open linked data is increasing, and that brings the necessity of resources to allow for the evaluation and comparison of such systems. Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) is a traditional benchmark event that occurs annually since 2011. However, although the multilingual task is available since its third edition, there is a necessity to foster the actual Portuguese Language resources present in this event benchmark. In this paper, we describe the development of the Portuguese language as a QALD corpus complement. The corpus is based on an existing QALD multilingual corpus and comprises 258 sentences used for the event challenge in 2017. We constructed a second corpus to allow direct comparison with the DBPedia Portuguese content. The main topics to highlight are the adopted methodology, which results in corpus related to frequent Brazilian Portuguese use of the language, and the work on adapting the answers to the DBPedia PT knowledge base, providing a corpus to evaluate Portuguese QA systems accurately.",

However, studies that systematically evaluate such models are still necessary for several applications. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the performance of deep neural language models on the semantic similarity tasks provided by the ASSIN dataset against classical word embeddings, both for Brazilian Portuguese and for European Portuguese. Our experiments indicate that the ELMo language model was able to achieve better accuracy than any other pretrained model which has been made publicly available for the Portuguese language, and that performing vocabulary reduction on the dataset before training not only improved the standalone performance of ELMo, but also improved its performance while combined with classical word embeddings. We also demonstrate that FastText skip-gram embeddings can have a significantly better performance on semantic similarity tasks than it was indicated by previous studies in this field.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, research in Natural Language Processing has witnessed an explosion in the application of neural networks and word embeddings. The goal of this paper is to explore how different word embedding models affect the performance of a dependency parser based on neural networks, and demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the cost of parsing using pre-trained embeddings. In order to do that, a jPTDP model was proposed. The results indicate the efficiency of the jPTDP as a dependency parser and the advantages of using embeddings with pre-trained words. The best results were obtained through the use of GloVe.",

We adopted the protocol of Kitchenham et al. for the review. The search in academic repositories found 771 works, from which 89 were selected. After a quality assessment step, 69 papers were chosen for data extraction. The results point to a divergence in terminology of this problem, two of which are more relevant, having specific techniques, corpus and application context: compound splitting and identifier splitting. We analyze the state of the art of each context, pointing out differences and similarities in approaches. We hope that these results can serve as a guide for future investigations and advancement of WSP.",

In order to consider this common-sense knowledge in target applications, we propose a deep learning model of common-sense knowledge in Portuguese language, which can be easily coupled in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems in order to leverage their performance. More specifically, the model is composed by a neural network LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) that receives a text from the target application, for example, an user message in a dialog, a response to a user tweet, a news text; and selects and learns what is the best set of common-sense relations to return to the target application, which should be considered in the target learning model or system. We implemented the common-sense learning module in two target applications - a Stance Classification system and an End-to-End Dialogue system. In both cases, incorporating the deep learning model improved the results.",

This context has generated some initiatives in Linguistics and Computation to investigate not only the informative content but also the media in which this mis/disinformation circulates. This paper describes one initiative, in particular, with satire. We present a linguistic analysis based on Brazilian Portuguese satirical news, seeking to understand how a user receives and shares this type of information and which are the main linguistic characteristics of these comments. We note that, while many users understand satirical content, many use the virtual/social environment to express a general comment about the news subject or even to make a toxic comment about a public person. Through this work, we intend to collaborate with the detection of misleading content and understand the behaviour of the user of social media, avoiding the improper sharing of this kind of news.",

Thus, it is still necessary post-editing to correct possible mistranslations output by the Machine Translation system. Several approaches have been proposed in order to also automate the post-editing task. This work addresses one of the main steps of an automatic post-editing tool: the automatic proposition of word replacements for a Machine Translation output. To do so, we propose a novel method based on bilingual word embeddings. In the experiments present in this paper we show the effectiveness of this approach in two of the most frequent lexical errors: ‘not translated word’ and ‘incorrectly translated word’.",

        "Abstract": "Semantic textual similarity algorithms are essential to several natural language processing tasks as clustering documents and text summarization. Many shared tasks regarding this subject were performed during the last few years, but generally, focused on a unique domain and/or language. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) is well known for its ability to compute similarity requiring less training data. We proposed a SNN architecture incorporated with language-independent features, aiming to perform short text similarity calculation in multiple languages and domains. We explored three different corpora from shared tasks: ASSIN 1 and ASSIN 2 with Portuguese journalistic texts and N2C2 (English clinical texts). We adapted the SNN proposed by Mueller and Thyagarajan (2016), in two ways: (i) the activation functions were changed to the ReLU, instead of the sigmoid function, and; (ii) we incorporated the architecture to accept three new lexical features and an embedding layer to infer the values of the pre-trained word embeddings. The evaluation was performed by the Pearson correlation (PC) and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the models’ predicted values and corpora’s gold standard. Our approach achieved better results than the baseline in both languages and domains.",

Considering the low availability of datasets and tools for this task in languages other than English, recently it has been proposed that multilingual resources can be used to improve Open IE methods for different languages. In this work, we present the CrossOIE, a multilingual publicly available relation tuple validity classifier that scores Open IE systems’ extractions based on their estimated quality and can be used to improve Open IE systems and assist in the creation of Open IE benchmarks for different languages. Experiments show that our model trained using a small corpus in English, Spanish, and Portuguese can trade recall performance for up to 27% improvement in precision.

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a comparative study of alignment pairs, either contrasting expressions or stylistic variants of the same expression in the European (EP) and the Brazilian (BP) varieties of Portuguese. The alignments were collected semi-automatically using the CLUE-Aligner tool, which allows to record all pairs of paraphrastic units resulting from the alignment task in a database. The corpus used was a children’s literature book\nOs Livros Que Devoraram o Meu Pai\n(The Books that Devoured My Father) by the Portuguese author Afonso Cruz and the Brazilian adaptation of this book. The main goal of the work presented here is to gather equivalent phrasal expressions and different syntactic constructions, which convey the same meaning in EP and BP, and contribute to the optimisation of editorial processes compulsory in the adaptation of texts, but which are suitable for any type of editorial process. This study provides a scientific basis for future work in the area of editing, proofreading and converting text to and from any variety of Portuguese from a computational point of view, namely to be used in a paraphrasing system with a variety adaptation functionality, even in the case of a literary text. We contemplate “challenging” cases, from a literary point of view, looking for alternatives that do not tamper with the imagery richness of the original version\n.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces an experimental study on the role of breathing patterns and acoustic characteristics on the appraisal of emotional content in two speech styles. The corpus is a song lyrics, read and sung by six professional lyrical singers, three men and three women. Three breathing parameters (breath cycle duration, inhalation duration and inhalation amplitude), twelve acoustic parameters, related to fundamental frequency, intensity, spectral tilt and Long Term Analysis, and one semantic descriptor (emotional impact) were analyzed. Results showed stylistic, gender and individual differences. Reading mainly differentiated from singing in relation to the three breathing measures and six acoustic measures. The durations of the breath cycles and the inhalations were higher in singing than in reading and in men than in women. The amplitude of the inhalation was an important factor in separating reading and singing in terms of emotional impact.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of diseases like Dementia is increasing worldwide due to the increase of average lifespan, and consequently, of elderly population. With no cure for dementia, there is a big focus on its early detection, as well as on cognitive stimulation which aims to delay the loss of cognitive abilities. However, there are not yet many technological solutions that allow elders to undergo cognitive stimulation exercises in a group context. This work aims to develop a multiplayer game for European Portuguese to be applied in the context of cognitive stimulation. The game, based on the format of a quiz, serves as a platform for elders to exercise their memory competing with each other, and thus, promoting social interaction which is of major importance for cognitive stimulation. To this end, the game incorporates a virtual gameshow host and speech and language technologies allowing for natural voice interactions. The preliminary results of the user satisfaction survey were generally positive. In particular, the multiplayer component was well received, reinforcing the potential of this type of system.",

        "Abstract": "We present a simple approach to create a “persona” conversational agent. First, we take advantage of a large collection of subtitles to train a generative model based on neural networks. Second, we manually handcraft a small corpus of interactions that specify our character (from now on the “persona corpus”). Third, we enrich a retrieval based engine with this corpus. Finally, we combine both into a single agent. A preliminary evaluation shows that the generative model can hardly implement a coherent “persona, but can successfully complement the retrieval model.",

Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems have the untapped potential to extract information from legal documents, which can improve information retrieval and decision-making processes. We introduce the UlyssesNER-Br, a corpus of Brazilian Legislative Documents for NER with quality baselines. The presented corpus consists of bills and legislative consultations from Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. We implemented Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) models, and the promising F1-score of 80.8% in the analysis by categories and 81.04% in the analysis by types, was achieved with the CRF model. The entities with the best average F1-score results were “FUNDlei” and “DATA”, and the ones with the worst results were “EVENTO” and “PESSOAgrupoind”. The corpus was also evaluated using a BiLSTM-CRF and Glove architectures provided by the pioneering state-of-the-art paper, achieving F1-score of 76.89% in the analysis by categories and 59.67% in the analysis by types.",

Designed for fine-grained linguistic analysis, the test suite comprises 330 test sentences for 66 linguistic phenomena and 14 linguistic categories. Eight different MT systems were compared using quantitative and qualitative methods via the test suite: DeepL, Google Sheets, Google Translator, Microsoft Translator, Reverso, Systran, Yandex and an internally built NMT system trained over 30 h on 2,5M sentences. It was found that ambiguity, named entity & terminology and verb valency are the categories where MT systems struggle most. Negation, pronouns, subordination, verb tense/aspect/mood and false friends are the categories where MT systems perform best.",

        "Abstract": "Most misinformation corpora are composed of explicitly\nreal\nand\nfake\nnews content. This results from the idea that misinformation can be approached as a binary classification problem. However, such approach oversimplifies the diversity of properties usually associated with credibility of different textual genres and types. To address this problem, we created MINT, a comprehensive annotated corpus of online articles collected from mainstream and independent Portuguese media sources, over a full year period. The collected articles include:\nhard news\n,\nopinion\narticles,\nsoft news\n,\nsatirical news\n, and\nconspiracy\ntheories. This paper describes the main linguistic properties underlying each category, and provides some insights based on the analysis of an annotation initiative performed by online readers. The results show that (i) conspiracy theories and opinion articles present similar levels of subjectivity, and make use of fallacious arguments; (ii) irony and sarcasm are not only prevalent in satirical news, but also in conspiracy and opinion articles; and (iii) hard news differ from soft news by resorting to more sources of information, and presenting a higher degree of objectivity.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, fake news has been massively propagated, causing different damages in society, such as impacting democracy processes and the management of health crises. In this context, automatic fake news classification systems have been profitably created to tackle this problem. These systems require balanced corpus to be used as training data for the machine learning models. In this article, we present a flexible corpus of fake news in Portuguese. To balance our corpus, besides the fake news, we also collected and processed content from real news, extracted from trustable web portals. We also present an automatic process for the corpus creation, which allows keeping it constantly updated. To validate our results and methodology, we performed a news classification experiment using the LSTM model, and we achieved great results, with a precision of 97% on classifying fake news and 92% on classifying real news.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a targeted syntactic evaluation of Transformer models for Galician-Portuguese. We defined three experiments that allow to explore how these models, trained with a masked language modeling objective, encode syntactic knowledge. To do so, we created a new dataset including test instances of number (subject-verb), gender (subject-predicative adjective), and person (subject-inflected infinitive) agreement. This dataset was used to evaluate monolingual and multilingual BERT models, controlling for various aspects such as the presence of attractors or the distance between the dependent elements. The results show that Transformer models perform competently in many cases, but they are generally confounded by the presence of attractors in long-distance dependencies. Moreover, the different behavior of monolingual models trained with the same corpora reinforces the need for a deep exploration of the network architectures and their learning process.",

Although its pertinence, there are few datasets available in Brazilian Portuguese and mostly comprise few samples. Therefore, this paper proposes creating a new fake news dataset named FakeRecogna that contains a greater number of samples, more up-to-date news, and covering a few of the most important categories. We perform a toy evaluation over the created dataset using traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Optimum-Path Forest, and Support Vector Machines. A Convolutional Neural Network is also evaluated in the context of fake news detection in the proposed dataset.",

The discourse bank covers explicit and implicit relations at intra and inter-sentential levels, and includes for now a total of 14,436 discourse relations. We present the main guidelines of our annotation and discuss specific cases. An experiment in inter-annotator agreement was performed and holds results of 0.88 F1-score for discourse relation identification, 0.71 Cohen’s K for the classification of discourse relation types, and 0,75 for top-level sense classification. The CRPC-DB will be distributed free of charge through the PORTULAN CLARIN infrastructure.",

        "Abstract": "Dependency parsing can enhance the performance of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models and can be leveraged to boost information extraction. NER tasks are essential to deal with clinical narratives, but models for Brazilian Portuguese dependency parsing are scarce, even less for clinical texts and its specificities. This paper reports on the development of a treebank of clinical narratives in Brazilian Portuguese and the drafting of guidelines. Based on a corpus of 1,000 clinical narratives manually annotated with semantic information, split into 12,711 sentences, we identified some characteristics of these texts that differ from traditional domains and have a deep impact on the annotation process, such as extensive use of acronyms and abbreviations, words not recognized by POS taggers, misspelling, special use of some symbols, different uses for numerals, heterogeneity of sentence sizes, and coordinated phrases without any punctuation. We developed a document to describe the annotation types and to explain how difficult cases should be treated to ensure consistency, including examples that could be found in this kind of texts. We created a Tag versus Frequency relation to justify some of the characteristics and challenges of the corpus. The corpus when completely annotated will be made available to the entire scientific community that performs research with clinical texts.",

In building the corpus, we made both random and supervised searches to maximize balance. Using four annotators, we have classified each tweet on four categories: support, against, neutral or inconclusive. Furthermore, we have annotated each tweet for sentiment: positive, negative, neutral, sarcasm or inconclusive. Our annotators yield strong inter-annotator agreement. In addition, we test a baseline model using a pre-trained BERT model for Portuguese. Results suggest that our data set is in line with its counterparts in other languages.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional text classification approaches often require a good amount of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in restricted domains or less widespread languages. This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of low-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language processing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of learning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results reported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall into two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as input. This paper proposes a new model,\nZeroBERTo\n, which leverages an unsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before the classification task. We show that\nZeroBERTo\nhas better performance for long inputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12% in the F1 score in the FolhaUOL dataset.",

Regulations required from their manufacturers or providers make it possible. This type of requirement also exists in the finance sector. Governments, international agencies, or civil institutions are responsible for creating, applying, and inspecting these regulations. Regulators from all spheres (federal, state, and municipal) constantly demand changes in the finance sector to meet current needs adequately. This paper presents the constant evolution of a banking compliance application in Brazil. It aims to classify the relevance or irrelevance of regulatory documents published by more than 100 Brazilian regulators, affecting the businesses of more than 40 departments of Banco do Brasil. The application uses a hybrid strategy, combining machine learning and rules for a binary classification challenge involving each company department. This work also presents a particular type of corpus imbalance called The Imbalance Within Class.",

Stopping this practice is a complex challenge that involves analyzing a large and diverse volume of data. In this work, we propose an approach to analyze invoices and extract information about measures and units from product descriptions using a neural network with the BiLSTM-CRF architecture. Our method can validate product quantity information to, for instance, check whether any product was bought or sold by a business without issuing an invoice. The results were evaluated according to precision, recall, and f-score. The proposed approach can correctly detect more than 90% of cases of each type of information, showing its feasibility to process invoice data.",

        "Abstract": "Most approaches to role-filler entity extraction (REE) rely on large labeled training corpora in which entity mentions are directly annotated in the input document. In this work, we leverage an existing knowledge base (KB) of entities to perform document-level REE from drug seizure petitions. We propose a system that learns to extract entities from petitions to fill 29 roles of a drug seizure event. Although we have access to a KB covering more than 170 thousand entities and six thousand petitions, such that each entity in the KB is linked to a specific petition, the mentions to an entity within a petition’s text are not annotated. The lack of these annotations brings challenges related to mismatches between entity values in the KB and entity mentions in the documents. Additionally, there are entities with same type or same value. Thus, we propose a distant annotation method to overcome these challenges and automatically label petition documents using the available KB. This annotation method includes a parameter that controls the balance between precision and recall. We also propose a strategy to effectively tune this parameter in order to optimize a given metric. We then train a BERT-based sequence labeling model that learns to identify entity mentions and label them. Our system achieves an\n\\(F_1\\)\nscore of 78.59 with precision over 82%. We also report ablation studies regarding the distant annotation method.",

        "Abstract": "Online communication provides space for content dissemination and opinion sharing. However, the limit between opinion and offense might be exceeded, characterizing hate speech. Moreover, its automatic detection is challenging, and approaches focused on the Portuguese language are scarce. This paper proposes an interface between linguistic concepts and computational interventions to support hate speech detection. We applied a Natural Language Processing pipeline involving topic modeling and semantic role labeling, allowing a semi-automatic identification of hate speech. We also discuss how such speech qualifies as a type of verbal violence widespread on social networks to reinforce a sexist stereotype. Finally, we use Twitter data to analyze information that resulted in virtual attacks against a specific person. As an achievement, this work validates the use of linguistic features to annotate data either as hate speech or not. It also proposes using fallacies as a potential additional feature to identify potential intolerant discourses.",

On the other hand, online reviews are an accessible resource for readers to evaluate a book or even get a general sense about it, including its genre. As the amount of book reviews is always increasing, using such information to genre classification needs a robust solution to deal with high volumes of data. In such a context, we introduce a model for automatically classifying book genres by analyzing online text reviews. We build a dataset of compiled texts from online book reviews. Then, we use multiple machine learning algorithms to categorize a book into a specific genre. Such a process enables to compare algorithms and detect the best classifiers. Hence, the most efficient machine learning algorithm completed the task with an accuracy of 96%; i.e., the proposed model is convenient for various information retrieval systems due to its high certainty and efficiency.",

Recently, NER systems based on neural networks have obtained state-of-the-art results. One of the main components of this kind of system is the word embeddings representation adopted that can be static (traditional) or contextual trained in language models. This work analyzes the strategy of combining traditional and contextual embeddings to obtain richer representations for Portuguese NER. We adopt a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) as a classification model integrated with the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) algorithm. Experiments were carried out in different corpora, and the results obtained demonstrate that the combination strategy of word embeddings models is viable and led to results comparable with state-of-the-art NER systems in Portuguese.",

For text classification tasks, BERT has already been extensively explored. However, aspects like how to better cope with the different embeddings provided by the BERT output layer and the usage of language-specific instead of multilingual models are not well studied in the literature, especially for the Brazilian Portuguese language. The purpose of this article is to conduct an extensive experimental study regarding different strategies for aggregating the features produced in the BERT output layer, with a focus on the sentiment analysis task. The experiments include BERT models trained with Brazilian Portuguese corpora and the multilingual version, contemplating multiple aggregation strategies and open-source datasets with predefined training, validation, and test partitions to facilitate the reproducibility of the results. BERT achieved the highest ROC-AUC values for the majority of cases as compared to TF-IDF. Nonetheless, TF-IDF represents a good trade-off between the predictive performance and computational cost.",

        "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence applied to Law is getting attention in the community, both from the Judiciary and the lawyers, due to possible gains in procedural celerity and the automation of repetitive tasks, among other use cases. Many of its benefits can be derived from Natural Language Processing since legal proceedings are textual document-based. Named Entity Recognition is the NLP task of identifying and classifying named entities in unstructured text to help achieve these goals. In recent years, transformers emerged as the new state-of-the-art architecture for some tasks in NLP systems. NLP resources in Portuguese, such as models and datasets, are needed to allow Portuguese speaking countries to benefit from this new NLP level. This paper presents the first fine-tuned BERT models trained exclusively on Brazilian Portuguese for Legal NER. The models achieved new state-of-the-art on LeNER-Br dataset, a Portuguese NER corpus for the legal domain. We also built a prototype application for Judiciary users to evaluate how the model performed with authentic law documents. The results showed that the models were able to extract information with good quality. Both the models and the prototype application are publicly available for the community.",

        "Abstract": "Legal text processing is a challenging task for modeling approaches due to the peculiarities inherent to its features, such as long texts and their technical vocabulary. Topic modeling consists of discovering a semantic structure in the text. This paper investigates the application of topic modeling and the use of information about the legislation cited in identifying the subject of legal documents and evaluating its applicability in the classification of Brazilian lawsuits. The models were trained with a Golden Collection of 16 thousand initial petitions and indictments from the Court of Justice of the State of Ceará, in Brazil, whose lawsuits were classified in the five more representative National Council of Justice (CNJ) of Brazil classes - Common Civil Procedure, Execution of Extrajudicial Title, Criminal Action - Ordinary Procedure, Special Civil Court Procedure, and Tax Enforcement. The results obtained outperform the baseline, achieving 0.89 of F1 score (macro). Our interpretation is that the representation of the document through contextual embeddings generated by BERT, as well as the architecture of the model with bidirectional contexts, makes it possible to capture the specific context of the domain of legal documents. Thus, the use of the legislation mentioned in the representation of documents can improve the accuracy of the classification task.",

        "Abstract": "Even though most of its energy generation comes from renewable sources, Brazil is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, due to intense farming and deforestation of biomes such as the Amazon Rainforest, whose preservation is essential for compliance with the Paris Agreement. Still, regardless of lobbies or prevailing political orientation, all government legal actions are published daily in the Brazilian Federal Official Gazette (BFOG, or “Diário Oficial da União\" in Portuguese). However, with hundreds of decrees issued every day by the authorities, it is absolutely burdensome to manually analyze all these processes and find out which ones can pose serious environmental hazards. In this paper, we present a strategy to compose automated techniques and domain expert knowledge to process all the data from the BFOG. We also provide the fff, a highly curated dataset, in Portuguese, annotated by domain experts, on federal government acts about the Brazilian environmental policies. Finally, we build and compared four different NLP models on the classification task in this dataset. Our best model achieved a F1-score of\n\\(0.714 \\pm 0.031\\)\n. In the future, this system should serve to scale up the high-quality tracking of all official documents with a minimum of human supervision and contribute to increasing society’s awareness of government actions.",

        "Abstract": "This work presents an analysis of Brazilian political discourse from speeches and social media posts, focusing on the ability to transfer learned models’ knowledge between different contexts. The analysis is conducted through PoliS, a new resource containing two datasets of political discussions labeled for party and ideological leaning from congressional speeches and social media posts by political influencers. The transfer learning experiments are performed using the transcripts of the congressional speeches to train a model used to predict the political leaning of social media influencers. To evaluate the robustness of the model, the analysis includes a time-lag study of the performance degradation of the transferred model. We find that relatively little social media data (about one hour) is needed to achieve reasonable performance in classification, and that performance does not degrade significantly over time.",

However, different questions demand different answering techniques; here we propose, build and validate an architecture that integrates different modules to answer two distinct kinds of queries. Our architecture takes a free-form natural language text and classifies it to send it either to a Neural Question Answering Reasoner or a Natural Language parser to SQL. We implemented a complete system for the Portuguese language, using some of the main tools available for the language and translating training and testing datasets. Experiments show that our system selects the appropriate answering method with high accuracy (over 99%), thus validating a modular question answering strategy.",

In many real-life scenarios, the lack of labeled data has become the biggest bottleneck preventing NER being effectively used in some domains and with some natural languages, with negative impacts on the quality of some tasks. To overcome the barrier of the lack of annotated data for new application domains in some natural languages, we propose a method that uses the output of an ensemble of NER’s to automatically annotate the data needed to train a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based NER for Portuguese. The performance was assessed using MiniHAREM dataset with promising results. For domain relevant classes such as LOCAL, F1, Precision and Recall above 50% were obtained when training only with automatically annotated data.",

Typically, this task is performed through models that perform lexical and translation operations, which tend to present a trade-off between meaning preservation and diversity. In this paper, we present a transformer-based approach called\nPTT5-Paraphraser\n, a PPT5 model fine-tuned on TaPaCo, a large corpus of paraphrases. PTT5-Paraphraser achieves good results according to a number of metrics, showing a good compromise between diversity and fidelity to the original meaning. Two human evaluations are made to explore the paraphrases produced by our model: the first analyzes their quality in terms of preserving the meaning and diversity of sentences, while the second compares automatically generated paraphrases with human-made ones. Finally, we perform a classification task, which shows that datasets augmented with paraphrases can substantially increase the performance of classifiers.",

        "Abstract": "This paper aims to summarize the key points and results of an analysis of the alignment of gesture and prosodic boundaries collected through manual an-notation and automated treatment. For this purpose, we used a multimodal corpus of spontaneous speech, the BGEST corpus [\n1\n], part of the C-ORAL-BRASIL language resources [\n10\n,\n23\n]. Gestures and prosodic boundaries were manually annotated with ELAN. The gestural an-notation followed partly the Linguistic Annotation System for Gestures guidelines [\n5\n], whereas the prosodic boundaries followed the perceptual criterion adopted in other C-ORAL resources. The tabular data outputted by ELAN was then analyzed by a script that compares the alignment of gesture phrases and intonation units. The results point to a larger gestural phrase that encompasses the intonation unit, while the stroke is almost always within the intonation unit. Around 85% of all information units align with a gesture. The analysis also points that the time values of alignment are shorter than analyzed by [\n17\n] both for initial as well for final boundaries and more complex than proposed by [\n6\n]. This indicates that more research is needed before we can set an approximate value for the overlap of larger units.",

This paper describes experiments on FPA for Brazilian Portuguese using Kaldi toolkit. Based on time-delay neural networks (TDNN), several acoustic models were trained on the top of the combination between hidden Markov models (HMM) and Gaussian mixture models (GMM). The nature of the input features and the topology of the HMMs have been varied in order to analyze each one’s influence. Results with respect to the phone boundary metric over a dataset of 385 hand-aligned utterances show that the network is mostly invariant to the input features, while regular HMM topologies do perform better in comparison to a modified version used in chain models. Conversely, the neural network still does not outperform GMM models for phonetic alignment.",

        "Abstract": "Deep learning techniques have been shown to be efficient in various tasks, especially in the development of speech recognition systems, that is, systems that aim to transcribe an audio sentence in a sequence of written words. Despite the progress in the area, speech recognition can still be considered difficult, especially for languages lacking available data, such as Brazilian Portuguese (BP). In this sense, this work presents the development of an public Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using only open available audio data, from the fine-tuning of the Wav2vec 2.0 XLSR-53 model pre-trained in many languages, over BP data. The final model presents an average word error rate of 12.4% over 7 different datasets (10.5% when applying a language model). According to our knowledge, the obtained error is the lowest among open end-to-end (E2E) ASR models for BP.",

        "Abstract": "This work presents a new database containing high sampling rate recordings of a single male speaker reading sentences in Brazilian Portuguese with neutral voice, along with the corresponding text corpus. Intended for synthesis and other speech-oriented applications, the dataset contains text scripts extracted from a popular Brazilian news TV program, read out loud by a trained individual in a controlled environment, resulting in roughly 20 h of audio data. The text was normalized in the recording process and special textual occurrences (e.g. acronyms, numbers, foreign names etc.) were replaced by their phonetic translation to a readable text in Portuguese. There are no noticeable accidental sounds and background noise has been kept to a minimum in all audio samples. To illustrate the potential benefits of having this data available, text-to-speech experiments were conducted using state-of-the-art models for speech synthesis (Tacotron 2 and Waveglow). As a result, we obtained intelligible and natural sounding voices from as few as 8 min of audio samples coming from an unseen target speaker, after having trained over our data; moreover, by increasing the target recording time to 75 min, we have noticeably improved accuracy in pronunciation.",

        "Abstract": "Palatal consonants in Portuguese are considered complex or marked segments because they are inherently heavy and restricted in terms of their distribution, in relation to other consonants. Moreover, they appear to display differences between themselves, as first language acquisition and creoles’ adaptation suggest that /ʎ/ is more complex than /ɲ/. The arguments for complexity are endorsed by some qualitative studies but are still lacking quantitative support. This paper aims at analyzing the phonological restrictiveness of these consonants by comparing their actual frequency in several different corpora, reporting both lexical entries and usage in discourse. In addition to their context-free frequency, we control for their word position and phonetic adjacency. We find that palatals are less frequent than other consonants. However, relative to each other, they do not display proportional lexical and usage frequencies. These results shed new light not only on the representation of /ɲ/ and /ʎ/ but also on the relation between frequency and markedness in language studies.",

        "Abstract": "We propose a methodology to populate the verb type hierarchy of a deep computational grammar in the HPSG formalism using syntactic and morphological information from Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks. It is exemplified by means of the UD Bosque corpus and PorGram, a computational grammar for Portuguese constructed in the LinGO Grammar Matrix framework, but it can be applied to analogous grammars of other languages using other UD treebanks. The main component of the methodology is a Python module that extracts from the annotated sentences the core arguments and other features that are relevant to determine verb valence. This module enables the creation of a Python dictionary that maps valence frames to verb objects. This dictionary facilitates not only determining which frames occur with which verbs, but also detecting annotation errors. The potential of the module for rapid expansion of the lexical coverage of PorGram and corpus annotation error detection is illustrated with concrete examples.",

        "Abstract": "The anchorage to real data is one of the main parameters that guarantees the quality and the coverage of lexical resources, especially in the context of specialized domains. Thus, lexicon extraction from corpora is a consensual method for building lexical resources. However, given that data validation by experts in specialized contexts is a necessary step, the automatic screening of data becomes fundamental to maximize the informational value of the interaction with experts. In this paper we present and discuss a hybrid methodology, combining linguistic and statistical approaches, focusing on the extraction of specialized lexical units and salient semantic information using CQL grammars. The proposed method involves several steps, from frequency information analyses, concordances and collocations extraction to manual revision and expert validation and encompasses the construction and application of knowledge-based patterns CQL grammars. We present two CQL grammars for lexical and semantic information extraction developed for Portuguese and Italian and evaluate results from its application to specialized corpora on Public Art domain, demonstrating the value of this method for lexicon and semantic information extraction from large data.",

        "Abstract": "We compiled a set of patterns that denote lexico-semantic relations in Portuguese, created templates where one argument is fixed and the other is replaced by a mask, and then used BERT for predicting the latter. For most relations and measures, when assessed in a test of lexico-semantic analogies, BERT predictions outperformed those of earlier methods computed from static word embeddings, either with a pattern alone or with a combination of patterns. There is still a large margin of progression, but this suggests that BERT can be used as a source of lexico-semantic knowledge in Portuguese.",

        "Abstract": "The lack of a pattern widely accepted in Corpus Linguistics for the construction of text corpora has resulted in multiple possible paths to compilation, resulting in research products that are difficult to interface and have low continuity. The variety of existing corpora aggravates this problem since individual studies use different forms of expression to describe and solve similar problems. Thus, a gap is identified in the production initiatives to create corpora regarding the “exploratory” way of conducting such initiatives. Based on the Lapelinc Workflow for the construction of historical corpora, the Lapelinc Framework presents a working pattern for construction and research activities involving Portuguese language corpora, thereby establishing a set of steps and by-products common to corpora-based linguistic research. Providing a set of tools in the Import Stage with a reduced learning curve and allowing the convergence of efforts during development, the Lapelinc Framework tools add functionalities for multiple purposes in the construction of corpora, simplifying the construction of multi-type corpora, facilitated by the resources it makes available.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) gained a lot of attention due to achieving state-of-the-art performance in many Natural Language Processing tasks. Such models are powerful due to their ability to learn underlying word association patterns present in large volumes of data, however, for the same reason, they reflect stereotypical human biases. Although the presence of biased word associations in language models is a ubiquitous problem that has been studied since the popularization of static embeddings (eg, Word2Vec), resources for quantifying stereotypes in LLMs are still quite scarce and primarily focused on the English language. To help close this gap, we release an evaluation dataset comprising sentence templates designed to measure stereotypes and negative attitudes towards migrant groups in contextualized word embedding representations for the Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan languages. Our multilingual dataset draws inspiration from social surveys that measure perceptions and attitudes towards immigration in European countries.",

However, this broad social interaction also exposes negative and harmful behaviors, such as harassment and misogyny. Misogyny, particularly, is a worrying phenomenon that perpetuates gender inequality and undermines the dignity and rights of women. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) emerges as a promising tool to analyze and understand the discourse of social networks. However, most of NLP research, sentiment analysis, and hate speech, focuses on languages such as English and, to a lesser extent, Spanish. This implies that other languages in general, and minority languages, such as Galician, in particular, are beyond the scope of this research, and that extrapolation of results and techniques is not explored.",

For Brazilian Portuguese, this task has been mainly studied for the linguistic variety of Minas Gerais via supervised machine learning methods. As manually annotating a large corpus with prosodic boundaries is a costly task, this paper brings three main contributions: (1) a publicly available corpus, prosodically annotated automatically and manually revised; (2) the code of the heuristic method of Biron et al. (2021), that uses discontinuities in speech rates and silence pauses, adapted to segment Brazilian Portuguese spontaneous speech; and (3) the evaluation of the method in the scope of NURC-SP corpus, linguistic variety of São Paulo, which suggests that: (i) the method is more suitable for defining non-terminal boundaries than for defining terminal boundaries; (ii) the method performs best by using all heuristics conjointly, but the silences’ heuristics stands out; and (iii) there are no significant differences in performance among different speech genres (conversational or talks) but further analysis should be carried out. The pipeline created was intended to accelerate the manual revision of prosodic boundaries, and therefore, a simple and fast method was chosen as it does not require a training phase.",

For example, in European Portuguese (EP) the word “autocarro” is used to refer to “bus”, while in Brazilian Portuguese (PB) the word “ônibus” is preferred. A precise localization can bring the communication between language variants closer, guaranteeing clear understanding among regional cultures that speak the same language. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Machine Translation approaches to localize sentences considering EP and BP. We assess the extent to which these models tend to paraphrase, quantifying the unnecessary changes made and evaluating the models with a human Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) analysis. We applied a contrastive analysis of the two variants and chose four models (rule-based with a Masked Language Model, pre-trained neural machine translation (NMT), and two GPT-4-based models) to test and analyze. Our results show that the generative Large Language Models (LLMs) consistently delivered superior performance, underscoring their adeptness at grasping EP and BP nuances.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to retrieve answers to natural language questions from a Knowledge Graph (KG), allowing users to obtain responses even without expertise in a KG query language like SPARQL. Most existing solutions focus on training Machine Learning (ML) models to convert questions in English into a specific query language. Only a few initiatives have been made for languages other than English, eg Portuguese, although it is the eighth most spoken language in the world and presents its linguistic challenges. Moreover, the number of datasets and examples in them to train ML models in other languages is also limited. This paper introduces KQGAPT, a system that relies on low-resource-based techniques to answer questions posed in Portuguese from KGs. Instead of training an entirely end-to-end solution, our system is built upon five components:(i) question analysis,(ii) question classification,(iii) phrase mapping,(iv) query generation, and (v) query ranking. Our contributions include trained models for question classification and query ranking specifically customized for the Portuguese language, offering a comprehensive solution for answering questions in Portuguese from KGs. The results are promising: requiring only a few examples, they outperform a baseline method that translates the input question from Portuguese to English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first KGQA solution designed for Portuguese that uses the standard QALD dataset.",

In recent years, the Transformer architecture has established itself as a state-of-the-art approach for machine translation between written languages. To allow the use of the Transformer architecture for translating Portuguese into Brazilian Sign Language, we represent the sign language in a written form with glosses. As Brazilian Signing Language is a low-research language, the effective training of the Transformer model is challenging. The paper presents experimental results exploring transfer learning from pretrained models of ten different language pairs: Portuguese-Galician, Galician-Portuguese, Portuguese-Catalan, Catalan-Portuguese, Portuguese-Ukrainian, Ukrainian-Portuguese, English-Spanish, English-French, German-Dutch, and German-Ukrainian. After transfer learning and considering the BLEU metric as the evaluation parameter, the experimental results show that the language pairs whose parent models had the biggest training datasets and vocabulary (English-Spanish, English-French, and German-Dutch) displayed the highest performances. The English-Spanish pair, the pair with the biggest training set, achieved the highest performance, followed by the English-French pair, the second biggest training set. The Galician-Portuguese pair, the pair with the smallest training set and vocabulary, presented the fourth-best BLEU score. One possible conjecture to explain this last result is the close relation between the languages.",

        "Abstract": "Streaming content advances and the appearance of online media raised the ability for massive content sharing that reaches thousands of people worldwide in a real-time fashion. Fake news spreading is nowadays the main concern of several authorities worldwide due to the negative impact and potential to induce social and political instability in our society. Therefore, fake news detection and suppression gained increased attention as an important topic in natural language processing and machine learning academic research. Regardless of the state-ofthe-art methods available for fake news detection, a good corpus revealing novel languagespecific counterfeit aspects is also important to exploit and distinguish between real and fake news in the context of social and political impacts for specific regions. This paper extends a previous Brazilian Portuguese corpora dataset and proposes using and comparing several deep learning and classical machine learning models to detect counterfeit content in the Portuguese language. Moreover, we propose using text summarization to achieve concise news summaries and prevent losing relevant information. This work presents an updated and balanced version of the FakeRecogna dataset for detecting fake news articles using a temporal learning approach based on efficient and well-known deep learning models.Streaming content advances and the appearance of online media raised the ability for massive content sharing that reaches thousands of people worldwide in a real-time fashion.

        "Abstract": "The automatic assessment of text readability and the classification of texts by levels is essential for language education and languagerelated industries that rely on effective communication. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) provides a widely recognized framework for classifying language proficiency levels. This framework can be used not only to assess the proficiency of learners of a given language, but also from a readability perspective, as a means to identify the proficiency required to understand specific pieces of text. In this study, we address the automatic assessment of text readability according to CEFR levels in European Portuguese. For that, we explore the fine-tuning of several foundation models on textual data used for proficiency evaluation purposes. Additionally, we aim at setting the ground for more comparable research on this subject by defining a new publicly available test set. Our experiments show that the best models can achieve around 80% accuracy and 75% macro F1 score. However, they have difficulty in generalizing to different types of text, which reveals the need for additional and more diverse training data.",

Utilizing the ToLD-Br dataset, which includes 21,000 annotated tweets, we examine the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the monolingual MariTalk from Maritaca AI. The study focuses on their effectiveness in identifying Toxic speech, the influence of few-shot learning, and the intricacies of annotating datasets, particularly regarding vulgar language (swear words). Our experiments reveal that MariTalk (Sabiá) demonstrates a nuanced understanding of colloquial Portuguese. Meanwhile, ChatGPT, especially when augmented with few-shot learning, shows robustness comparable to baseline methods. This investigation underscores the value of both monolingual and lower-capacity models in the nuanced field of language-specific Toxic speech detection, offering insights into their competitive edge against models like ChatGPT.",

While most OpenIE methods are primarily optimized for English, only few works in the literature explore their uses for cross-lingual and multilingual scenarios. Despite the growing interest in Portuguese OpenIE methods, the use LLMs for Portuguese focused OpenIE is still an underdeveloped topic in the area. Our study addresses this research gap by examining the viability of using open and commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering for Portuguese OpenIE. We provide an analysis of the performance of these LLMs in OpenIE tasks, revealing that they achieve performance metrics comparable to state-of-the-art systems. In addition, we have fine-tuned and launched an open LLM for OpenIE (PortOIELlama), which outperforms commercial LLMs in our experiments. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs in Portuguese OpenIE tasks and suggest that further refinement and finetuning of larger models could enhance these results.",

        "Abstract": "Attributing authorship to text can be a complex problem for both specialists and AI systems. This difficulty arises from challenges like capturing distinct writing styles and authors, handling texts from the same era and languages, or distinct heteronyms of the same writer, or identifying the author’s gender. Traditionally, solutions for authorship attribution have required the extraction of numerous attributes, frequently obtained through specialized linguistic tools, coupled with the availability of extensive training documents. The advent of Deep Learning transformers has further amplified this reliance on data quantity. Classic classification approaches usually assign a class to documents to be classified, even if they are too strange concerning the classes learned in the training phase. However those strange texts should be rejected based on founded approaches, in order to enhance the classifiers reliability.",

Our findings indicate that frame semantic cosine similarity between subtitles and audio of the same video can capture the semantic differences between the original spoken sentence and the choices made by the translator to make it possible for the message to fit within the limitations set by the subtitling industry.",

        "Abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges posed by multi-word adverbs in the context of natural language parsing, with a specific focus on Portuguese adverbs; eg à beça ‘a lot’and às três pancadas ‘in a hurry’or ‘carelessly’. These adverbs present complex combinatorial constraints and often carry non-compositional, idiomatic meanings, making them a significant hurdle for natural language processing systems. Recognizing them as distinct lexical units at an early stage of parsing is crucial. To investigate this issue, we conducted experiments using a selection of the 300 most frequently occurring multi-word adverbs from the Portuguese TenTen2020 corpus. We employed two different parsers, one rule-based and one statisticalbased, and presented the results of these experiments. The main goal of this paper is to advocate for the development of enhanced lexical resources to facilitate the accurate parsing of these expressions. This includes broader lexical coverage of these units and a more detailed syntactic description, particularly about distinguishing between sentence-external and sentence-internal modifiers. Furthermore, we provide an update on an ongoing project aimed at creating this crucial lexical resource, with a specific focus on Brazilian Portuguese. Our current dataset includes 3,500 compound adverbs, each annotated with syntactic and semantic information, and it covers two regional varieties of Portuguese, namely Brazilian and European Portuguese.",

We present TransAlign, a cross-linguistic data alignment framework for translating and aligning OpenIE datasets to target languages using language-specific grammatical rules. We explore this methodology for the Portuguese language, employing LSOIE, a large-scale dataset for supervised Open Information Extraction, AACTRANS+ CLP, and CARB datasets. We employed high-quality translation models and hand-crafted alignment rules, based on grammatical information, to ensure that the triples are correctly aligned according to the grammar of Brazilian Portuguese. This process resulted in the generation of 96.067 high-quality triples, which laid the foundation for our Portuguese-specific OpenIE dataset. We trained two models by utilizing this dataset, which achieved 10.53% improvement in F1 scores compared to the existing state-of-the-art systems for the Portuguese language, such as PortNOIE (Cabral et al., 2022), including LLMs models.",

The main objective for this paper is to address some of the limitations of the development of Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model using automatically annotated data, making it more suited for new domain scenarios. The proposed extension to the method is based on a state-of-the-art Open Information Extraction (Open IE) system, that combined with a mapper provides automatic annotation to fine-tune Deep Learning (DL) models. A proof-of-concept of the proposal was implemented and assessed with WikiNER dataset. Several factors were studied regarding their influence in the performance: different DL models to serve as basis for the fine-tuning process (BERT, RoBERTa, BART); the number of entities considered; and the training set size. The study confirmed the potential of the approach and demonstrated the capability of models to achieve Precisions above 75% for sets of entities with 20 elements.",

Resources for Automatic Essay Scoring in Portuguese are however scarce, not publicly available or contain inaccuracies that degrade performance. Moreover, they lack data provenance and a richer annotation and analysis. In this work we mitigate those issues by presenting a new benchmark for the task in Brazilian Portuguese. We accomplish that by downloading a collection of publicly available essays from websites that simulate University Entrance Exams, making both processed and raw data available, having a subset of the essays graded by expert annotators to assess the quality and difficulty of the task, and carrying out an extensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art predictors considering multiple evaluation criteria.",

There are, however, very limited assets that allow researchers of under-resourced languages to analyse the effect of predictors such as ambient frequency (AF), functional load (FL) and AC on the age of emergence (AoE) of phonemes. This paper describes the development of a new open access resource, the Preditores da Aquisição de Consoantes (PAC) database, which allows the exploration of these issues for European Portuguese (EP) and comparing the results with a typologically unrelated language, Tunisian Arabic (TA). Novel AC, AF, and FL values were calculated for EP and TA consonant inventories. The AoE was estimated using multiple regression models, with results showing the AC predictor had the largest effect in both languages, with AoE values within the ranges previously reported for typically developing monolingual children.",

TEFE has been applied to one volume of the Portuguese Livros das Monções (Monsoon Books), concerning the time gap between 1614 and 1616, highlighting conflict-related categories of events. A historical analysis of this special category of events is performed, revealing aspects of a generalized juncture of war and conflict in Asia in the early seventeenth century.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we explore the computational discernibility of Portuguese language discourse domains using a balanced sample from the Carolina corpus, including its five largest domains: Juridical, Entertainment, Journalistic, Virtual, and Instructional. We analyze discernibility across three levels: degree of duplication, linguistic features distribution, and separability within semantic embedding spaces. We found clear quantitative differences between domains at all levels, compatible with expected qualitative properties. Our analysis shows that these domains can be distinguished based on various computable text properties, and suggests a consistent complexity scale between them. We identify the distinguishing properties and their potential benefits for NLP tasks. Additionally, we provide domain-balanced and deduplicated versions of Carolina for future research.",

However, recent advances in Natural Language Processing can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present the selflearning fine-tuning of a BERT model designed for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using active sampling. Our study focuses on legislative documents written in Brazilian Portuguese, using the labeled data from the UlyssesNERBr corpus and the unlabeled data from the bill’s summary of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. We achieved F1-scores of 86.70±2.28 around the cross-validation and a final result of 90%, establishing the efficacy of BERTimbau with self-learning in performing Named Entity Recognition for legislative texts encompassing various categories. Our findings highlight its significant potential for enhancing legislative text analysis tasks.",

        "Abstract": "Automatically identifying hate speech is an emerging field driven by the growth of social media and the consequent amplification of communication. However, this domain faces challenges due to the nuances of the language and variations in expression. In some countries, such as Brazil, the focus of this paper, hate speech can be typified as a crime by law. Nonetheless, enforcing the law is challenging, given the complexity of distinguishing hateful comments among the volume of interactions on social media. This work evaluates the abilities of language models to distinguish among neutral, offensive, and hate speech social media posts. Two classes of models are explored: three PT-BR BERT-based classifiers tailored explicitly for the task and two generative chatbots in an in-context learning approach. Given the impracticability of adjusting chatbots weights, we propose to enhance prompts by adding context based on topic modeling and selecting demonstration examples based on either their semantic or size proximity to the tested instances. The experimental results show that tuned small language models, even in a low-cost regime, are still superior to chatbots. Nevertheless, chatbots with enhanced prompts also exhibited promising results without further training.",

ChatGPT was compared with traditional knowledge-based methods and with a fine-tuned BERT model for emotion detection in Portuguese. We found that a simple heuristic based on named entity recognition performed better than ChatGPT in the AD task. In the PC task, ChatGPT showed a significantly greater potential to associate polarity with aspect than the other investigated approaches. The highest efficiency achieved using ChatGPT on the PC task was a macroaverage F-measure of 57.88%, while the second best approach combining the use of lexicon with the BERT model achieved a macroaverage F-Measure of 39.30%.",

However, legal documents differ from the general texts, as the former involves technical texts of a legal nature, which are generally longer and contain more sophisticated vocabulary than the general domain texts. In this article, we propose the CLSJUR. BR, a Contrastive Learning model for automatic and abstractive summarization of legal documents in Portuguese language, that applies the reference-free evaluation technique. CLSJUR. BR was trained and evaluated using the Ruling. BR corpus, composed of judicial decisions from the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil.

        "Abstract": "This paper discusses our effort to build an automatic Portuguese readability assessment system aimed at Portuguese language learners. We demonstrate that using linguistic complexity features combined with traditional machine learning techniques allows for more control over selecting features that are more informative, resulting in models that generalize better to texts in authentic language learning environments. Using 489 linguistic complexity measures automatically extracted from a corpus of 500 texts annotated according to their level, we train random forest and LogitBoost classifiers to predict the CEFR level of a given text. Subsequently, we investigate the models’ generalizability by testing them on an independently collected and annotated corpus. We conclude that through using more informative features, the models’ capacity to generalize to novel data can increase even if performance on the test set extracted from the training data decreases.",

It uses Named Entity Recognition in Query (NERQ) to expand the queries, seeking to improve an integrated Information Retrieval system. In this sense, a proposal is made to update an existing pipeline, which was evaluated using an experimental approach, with different combinations of text pre-processing techniques, and the use of learning models. Two named entities from a legislative corpus for NER were used. The results show that the combination of RM3 and our method using a BERT model tuned for NER in the legislative domain obtained the best performance, significantly enhancing the accuracy of document retrieval, with an average improvement of around 1.94%(best results) and 8.58%(overall). Additionally, the recall in 20 documents (R@ 20) has been increased from 0.7356 to 0.7458.",

        "Abstract": "Dialect Identification is the task of determining the regional or social variety of a spoken or written language. While specific languages have received considerable attention in this regard, others, such as Portuguese, remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, previous works on the Portuguese language are often outdated in the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP, and many suffer from methodological flaws. We revisit the task of differentiating between European and Brazilian variants of Portuguese, addressing and rectifying the mistakes found in prior research. For that, we carefully select a parallel corpus and explore both feature-based traditional classifiers and state-of-the-art neural approaches. Our findings 1 demonstrate that whereas Transformer-based models provide solutions that are robust to out-of-distribution data, traditional NLP techniques are still competitive in this task.",

Investigating accent classification methods is a way towards accent-aware speech-processing. This paper evaluates accent classification for spontaneous speech using CNN-LSTM networks and the Wav2vec2 model. We study the importance of dataset size, pre-trained models, and external validation. For that, we used 90 hours of data, encompassing 9 accents and involving 204 speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, obtained from manually annotated subsets from Spotify Podcasts and CORAA ASR. Our best results range from 82% (closed-dataset) to 75% (cross-dataset) F1-scores for binary classification. Unless there is speaker leakage from training to testing, accent classification models trained from scratch fail for spontaneous speech data. Therefore, methods should be evaluated using both out-of-speaker and cross-dataset scenarios. We contributed with an experimental protocol for this task with a novel dataset. Finally, our results highlight the value of larger accent-annotated datasets and the use of larger pre-trained models.",

Experiments revealed that pre-training on legal and general data resulted in more effective models for legal tasks, with RoBERTaLexPT outperforming larger models trained on generic corpora, and other legal models from related works. We also aggregated a legal benchmark, PortuLex benchmark.

To address such a problem, different pre-training strategies have been proposed for developing domain-specific language models, including cross-domain transfer learning and continuous domain-adaptive pre-training with in-domain data. Within this context, we investigate different pre-training strategies to enhance NER in Portuguese-written Literature. We introduce two models, LitBERT-CRF and LitBERTimbau, that leverage domain-specific literary data while building upon general-domain language models. Moreover, we compare crossdomain transfer learning with a general-domain baseline. Overall, our results reveal that both domain-adaptive and transfer learning models outperform the baseline, achieving an F1-Score of over 75% in a strict evaluation scenario and over 80% in a partial scenario.",

However, user-generated content is not always secure or adequate. The goal of customer review moderation is to ensure both a secure environment for all parties participating and the integrity of the review information. Content moderation is a difficult task even for human moderators, and in some circumstances, due to the enormous volume of reviews, manual content moderation is not practical. In this paper, we present the experiments carried out using automated machine learning (AutoML) for moderating product reviews on one of Brazil’s largest e-commerce platforms. Our machine learning-based solution is faster and more accurate than the previously used content moderation system, performed by a third-party company system dependent on human intervention. Overall, the results showed that our model was 31.12% more accurate than the third-party company system and it had a fast development due to the use of AutoML techniques.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents a parsing model–whose corresponding system is named Portparser–for Brazilian Portuguese, which outperforms current systems for news texts in this language. Following the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework, we build our model by using a recently released manually annotated corpus (Porttinari-base) for training. We test different parsing methods and explore parameter settings in order to propose a highly accurate model, encompassing not only the dependency annotation, but also the Part of Speech tagging and the identification of lemmas and the related morphological features. Our experiments show that our best model achieves around 99% accuracy for Part of Speech tagging, lemma, and morphological features, with around 95% for dependency annotation, surpassing known systems for Portuguese by up to 7% accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis of the proposed model to show the current limitations and challenges for future works.",

To achieve this, a simple modeling algorithm was developed to allow the transmission of innovative linguistic elements within a network based on European geographical data. The results obtained show differences between propagation patterns of items originating from and reaching more connected, more isolated and more peripheral regions. These outcomes support Bartoli’s theory, including regarding West Iberian languages (such as Portuguese and Galician) and their sometimes archaizing tendencies.",

These models, pre-trained on extensive and diverse corpora, have become increasingly capable of comprehending the intricacies of language. Despite the abundance of LLMs for many high-resource languages, the availability of such models remains limited for European Portuguese. We introduce GlórIA, a robust European Portuguese decoder LLM. To pre-train GlórIA, we assembled a comprehensive PT-PT text corpus comprising 35 billion tokens from various sources. We present our pre-training methodology, followed by an assessment of the model's effectiveness on multiple downstream tasks. Additionally, to evaluate our models' language modeling capabilities, we introduce CALAME-PT (Context-Aware LAnguage Modeling Evaluation for Portuguese), the first Portuguese zero-shot language-modeling benchmark. Evaluation shows that GlórIA significantly outperforms existing open PT decoder models in language modeling and that it can generate sound, knowledge-rich, and coherent PT-PT text. The model also exhibits strong potential for various downstream tasks.",

Our experiments reveal that LLMs can effectively leverage prior knowledge from existing tagged datasets and can also extract linguistic structure with arbitrary labels.

We explore DST in Portuguese dialogues, marking the first known application specific to this language. We introduce a new task-oriented dialogue dataset in Portuguese, adapted from the widely-used MultiWOZ, and propose to leverage available question-answering (QA) models for slot filling. Predefined questions are made to user’s utterance, in a process that does not require training in dialogue data. We evaluate two QA models, based on BERT-base and on T5, select suitable thresholds on their scores, and test both intent recognition, as a preliminary step, and post-processing for matching categorical slots. Performance is still far from the stateof-the-art for English, but incorporating intent recognition and post-processing significantly improves performance. These findings not only advance DST within Portuguese-speaking communities but also create opportunities for new dialogue systems in Portuguese.",

While automatic machine learning models have been effective in moderating the vast amount of data on online social networks, low-resource languages, such as Brazilian Portuguese, still lack efficient automated moderation tools. We address this gap by creating a high-quality dataset collected from some of the most popular Brazilian Reddit communities. To that end, we manually labeled a sample dataset of 2,500 comments extracted from the most engaging communities. We conducted an in-depth exploratory analysis to gain valuable insights into the language of toxic and non-toxic content. Our results show a high level of agreement among annotators, attesting to the suitability of this dataset for various downstream machine learning tasks. This research offers a significant contribution to the creation of a safer online environment for users engaging in discussions in Portuguese and paves the way for more effective automatic moderation tools using machine learning.",

To enhance this aspect of the game development process, in this work, we propose a novel semiautomatic approach for generating animations for Role-Playing Game (RPG) based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) over narrative texts. We conducted a case study to validate our strategy in which, using three well-known themes, text was generated by an artificial intelligence system, and animations were subsequently created based on these texts.",

        "Abstract": "A major challenge in Natural Language Processing is obtaining annotated data for supervised learning. An option is the use of crowdsourcing platforms for data annotation. However, crowdsourcing introduces issues related to the annotator's experience, consistency, and biases. An alternative is to use zero-shot methods, which in turn have limitations compared to their few-shot or fully supervised counterparts. Recent advancements driven by large language models show potential, but struggle to adapt to specialized domains with severely limited data. The most common approaches therefore involve the human itself randomly annotating a set of datapoints to build initial datasets. But randomly sampling data to be annotated is often inefficient as it ignores the characteristics of the data and the specific needs of the model. The situation worsens when working with imbalanced datasets, as random sampling tends to heavily bias towards the majority classes, leading to excessive annotated data. To address these issues, this paper contributes an automatic and informed data selection architecture to build a small dataset for few-shot learning. Our proposal minimizes the quantity and maximizes diversity of data selected for human annotation, while improving model performance.",

Stance Detection for citizen political opinions is highly dynamic because bill trends can appear and disappear quickly, demanding Stance Detection to handle unseen topics. We investigate the potential of leveraging generative models as annotators to enrich the dataset and improve the classification models in the restricted Brazilian Portuguese language in a low-resource context. We propose to use the prompt to perform a zeroshot corpus expansion using a generative model as an annotator to enhance the specialist finetuned models. We tested the data augmentation method by training mBert and Bertimbau models on UlyssesSD, BrMoral, and MtTwitter datasets for unseen topics. The models using our proposed corpus expansion showed promising performance on unseen topics.",

Based on these observations, this work presents initial experiments on mental health prediction from textual and non-textual Twitter data in Portuguese, comparing a traditional content-based approach using BERT with models based on social media connections (friends, followers and mentions), and which is inspired from the well-known Bag-of-Words text representation. Results highlight an advantage for the model based on textual contents, but also suggest that the use of non-textual information may provide a significant contribution to these tasks.",

        "Abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid proliferation of technologies led to an increased dependence on social media and remote communication. This shift highlighted a noteworthy trend: the deliberate use of inaccurately written expressions as a unique mode of communication. These expressions often take form of intentional misspellings, such as substituting letters with similar phonetic sounding numbers or replacing acute accents with letter' h'. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of correcting these intentionally incorrect expressions using techniques documented in existing literature, specifically the N-Gram, Levenshtein Distance Measure, and Soundex phonetic algorithm. After assembling a dataset of posts and applying these correction techniques, series of tests were conducted, incorporating various parameter configurations to determine their effectiveness. Results revealed a 100% accuracy rate for Levenshtein Distance and N-Gram techniques for one of the error categories we analysed. Also, excluding the initial letter from the Soundex code improved its accuracy, although it ranged from 22% to 96%. Nevertheless, the Levenshtein Distance Measure approach emerged as the most significant option for correcting intentional errors in various examined categories, achieving 100% accuracy rate across a range of parameter permutations.",

The 2,000 most frequent adjective lemmas in a reference corpus, corresponding to 87.94% of the occurrences of adjectives, were classified into predicative and non-predicative. The former were further classified based on argument number (one or two) and type (noun phrase or clause), which led to six different classes of predicative adjectives plus two subclasses. The results suggest that the most representative class is non-predicative adjectives, followed by intransitive adjectives with noun phrase and clausal subjects, respectively.",

Our aim is to assess their suitability for African varieties of Portuguese. To evaluate their performance, we create two test sets for each variety, encompassing both spoken and written language. We measure the percentage of sentences in which one model outperforms the other in terms of perplexity. This evaluation seeks to ascertain whether one model shows more adaptability to the African varieties of Portuguese. Our findings reveal that Albertina PT-PT consistently outperforms Albertina PT-BR in scenarios involving spoken language corpora. However, in written registers, the advantage of Albertina PTPT is less pronounced for the Portuguese varieties of Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Principe. These insights contribute to our understanding of the adaptability of existing language models to African Portuguese varieties and emphasize the need for specialized models to address the unique linguistic nuances of this region.",

In European Portuguese, most of the studies on this subject focus on identifying the level of texts used for proficiency evaluation purposes according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). However, the ordinal nature of the levels is not considered by the classification models used in those studies. In this paper, we address the problem as a regression task in an attempt to leverage that information. Our experiments using fine-tuned versions of a state-ofthe-art foundation model for Portuguese show that addressing the problem as a regression task leads to improved performance in terms of adjacent accuracy and improved generalization ability to different kinds of textual data.",

        "Abstract": "Currently there are several methods to annotate different levels of a document, however, these methods all have their own output and some even create their own formats to share the results of processing. This makes it so that retrieving, sharing, and comparing information from these different methods is not a trivial task. Knowledge graphs are a flexible tool that can be used to counter this difficulty as it creates the possibility of having annotations at different levels of the text (document, sentence and word for example). Besides this, Knowledge Graphs also provide us with the possibility of using different Machine Learning algorithms which can be applied to different Natural Language Processing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition. In this work we present a first assessment of using Graph Machine Learning algorithms to perform Named Entity Recognition on the Portuguese Language. We use the Portuguese portion of the WikiNER dataset and process it as a Knowledge Graph with extra features from Universal Dependencies to perform a Node Classification Task for Named Entity Recognition. We present the results for 3 different GraphML approaches with different sub-graph combinations and discuss how this could be used in the future to predict new nodes that come into the network. The approach used can be adapted to other languages as there is nothing specific to the Portuguese language other than the dataset.",

        "Abstract": "Research in the field of automatic summarization, particularly in abstractive summarization, for the Portuguese language still faces a significant challenge due to the limited availability of datasets with annotated summaries. Although existing datasets enable research, they are comparatively smaller than those available for the English language, thereby impeding the attainment of more robust results. This paper introduces RecognaSumm, a novel Portuguese dataset comprising a diverse set of journalistic texts annotated with summaries. With a total of 135,272 samples, it stands as the largest known Portuguese summarization dataset to date, to the best of our knowledge. Additionally, this work introduces an abstractive summarization model trained on this dataset 1, offering a baseline for future studies.",

Despite advancements in talking head synthesis methods, challenges persist in terms of achieving precise control, robust generalization, and adaptability to various scenarios and speaker characteristics.

This work introduces a novel two-stage framework for Brazilian Portuguese talking head generation, combining the strengths of Transformers and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In the first stage, the transformer-based model extracts rich contextual information from the audio speech input, generating facial landmarks. In the second stage, we employ a GAN-based framework to translate the facial representations into photorealistic video frames. This framework separates the modeling of dynamic shape variations from the realistic appearance, partially addressing the challenge of generalization. Moreover, it becomes possible to assign multiple appearances to the same speaker by adjusting the trained weights of the second stage. Objective metrics were used to evaluate the synthesized facial speech, showing that it closely matches the ground-truth landmarks.",

The study encompasses an exploration of varying vocabulary sizes employing the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) subword segmentation methodology, with a particular emphasis on BLEU scores. Our results reveal a consistent preference for smaller BPE models. This preference persists across different scales of training data. The study underscores the importance of vocabulary size in NMT, providing insights for languages with varying data volumes.",

The solution uses techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning to classify the complaints into admissible and inadmissible categories. The proposed system was evaluated on a corpus of real corruption complaints from Brazil. The results showed that the solution achieved an area under the ROC curve of 83% in the classification task, which was very close to the performance of tested and validated approaches for general complaint analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems, the current leading approach in Machine Translation, still face difficulties when translating spatial language. In this paper, we use Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR) to represent spatial information in English-Portuguese automatic translations. We identify causes of unnatural translations by translating 145 sentences from CAM and COCA using Google Translate and DeepL. Applying QSR, we logically represent meaning differences. Our results show that despite good overall performance, NMT engines struggle with specific spatial meanings, resulting in a 10.6% sense error rate and a 12.0% error in syntactic projections. This work addresses practical and theoretical MT challenges.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents the compilation and tagging processes of a corpus of written texts produced by test takers of the Celpe-Bras examthe official Brazilian proficiency exam in Portuguese as an Additional Language (PAL). In order to identify language use patterns that distinguish the different proficiency levels, the main purpose of this corpus is to enable a wider range of quantitative and qualitative analyses. The data consists of approximately 15,000 texts written in four editions of Celpe-Bras, which are in the process of being digitized, deidentified and tagged. According to the guidelines for the typing and proofreading stages, the texts must be typed following the original handwriting and excluding any information that could identify the test taker. The tagging protocol established by the research team includes spelling normalizations to allow the use of automatic analyses besides signaling typical features of the genres required in the exam. Upon completion and availability of this corpus, further analyses will allow for more refined descriptions of each certified proficiency level, enhancing the validation process of Celpe-Bras.",

        "Abstract": "Despite automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems evolving with deep learning methods, for languages with a shortage of open/public resources, the resulting systems still present low-quality performance. On the other hand, Text-to-Speech (TTS) has also evolved in the last decade, allowing zero-shot multi-speaker TTS (ZS-TTS) models to generate speech of a target speaker using only a few seconds of their speech. These advances motivated the use of ZS-TTS in the training of ASR systems to improve model performance. However, ZS-TTS models still require a large number of diverse speakers and hours of speech during training, thus hindering their practical use in languages with less accessible data. In this work, we explored ZS-TTS in scenarios with few available speakers. We proposed the use of flow-based models due to their state-of-the-art (SOTA) results and explored the use of multilingual models, seeking to leverage available data from languages with many speakers. The results achieved in this work enabled the development of ZS-TTS and zero-shot voice conversion (VC) systems in languages with few available speakers. The proposed approach was applied to improve ASR systems in two languages, simulating a scenario with only one speaker available for training the ZS-TTS model. Despite using only one speaker in the target languages, our data augmentation approach achieved results comparable to the SOTA in English.",

        "Abstract": "The Supreme Federal Court (STF), the highest judicial instance in Brazil, generates an immense amount of data organized in text format, including decisions, petitions, injunctions, appeals, and other legal documents, much like lower-level courts. These documents are grouped and classified by specialized employees involved in legal process initiation (case filing), who, in specific cases, utilize technological tools for support. Some cases that reach the STF, for instance, are categorized under one or more Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda. This categorization aims to facilitate internal and external assessments of the court’s performance in addressing the central themes of the Agenda. Given the manual and repetitive nature of this task and its connection to pattern detection, it is feasible to develop machine learning and artificial intelligence-based tools for this purpose. In this study, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are proposed for process clustering with the goal of augmenting the database concerning certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with limited recorded occurrences. The clustering or grouping activity, which is highly significant in its own right, can also bring unlabeled entries around processes already categorized by the Court team. This, in turn, enables new labels to be assigned to similar processes. The results obtained demonstrate that augmented sets through clustering can be utilized in supervised learning workflows to assist in case classification, especially in contexts with imbalanced data.
